@275 = ~Traitor's scroll

We showed the charred brimstone scroll we got from the goblin sappers to Lady Elytharra. 
She told us it was one of a pair of scrolls.  Provided that the user knows something of spellcraft, they can teleport the holder of the second scroll (and the holder's allies, presumably) to the location of the first one.  Which means that someone within town teleported the goblins into the caves beneath the warehouse.  We should see if we can find this traitor and then tell Elytharra.~
@276 = ~Bottle of Spirit

We showed Cahl-Hyred's ghost-touched bottle to the Lady Elytharra. 
She told us that the bottle could be used to hold some of the substance of the ethereal plane within it.  If we could obtain some of the ethereal plane and place it within the bottle, the material could be used to enchant an item or a weapon.  It bears looking into.~
@277 = ~Bottle of Spirit

During our conversation with Elytharra, 
it occurred to us that we could place some of the tears of the spirit from the Weeping Widow into the ghost-touched bottle.~
@282 = ~Sick Diviner

Elytharra mentioned that one of the wounded in the Temple Pavilion, a diviner named Valin Geldencross, has taken ill
He became ill shortly before his attempt to divine the location of the goblin fortress.  Sounds suspicious.  Elytharra said that without knowing the cause and nature of his ailment, he is likely to die.~
@283 = ~Traitor's scroll

We told Elytharra that Phaen attacked us as soon as he saw we had the scroll.
She thanked us for exposing him before he could do more harm.~
@284 = ~Sick Diviner

We told Elytharra that we had aided Valin, and that he was conscious again.  
She was pleased and told us Targos was in our debt.~
@285 = ~Traitor's scroll

We told Elytharra that Phaen attacked us as soon as he saw we had the scroll.
She thanked us for exposing him before he could do more harm.  We also told her about Phaen's master, Harshom, and she seemed deeply concerned.~
@466 = ~Hedron's Mother

We saved an elderly woman, Firtha Kerdos, from a small pack of goblins that had entered her home.
She was more angry than grateful for our efforts and drove us from the house - small thanks indeed for saving her life.~
@467 = ~Hedron's Mother

We saved Hedron's mother from a small pack of goblins that had entered her home.
She was more hysterical than grateful for our efforts and accused us of being robbers - small thanks indeed for saving her life.~
@635 = ~Chieftain Gutma

We have met the ranger Braston in the bowels of the Horde Fortress.
He informed us that the leader of the horde is one called Guthma.  Our killing of Guthma should disrupt the horde and provide the relief that Targos and the Ten-Towns require.~
@636 = ~Sherincal

The ranger Braston believes that Sherincal, the one we overheard talking to Guthma, could be further directing the horde.
However, he was quick to point out that even if this Sherincal was directing Guthma, our removal of Guthma should be enough to stop the attacks on Targos.~
@637 = ~Ennelia and Braston

We freed the ranger Braston from the Horde Fortress and saw him safely back to Ennelia's hiding spot.
Unfortunately, during the time we have been away, Ennelia has fallen victim to her wounds and the elements.  Braston moved on for parts unknown to mourn for the loss of his lover Ennelia.  ~
@739 = ~Docks of Targos

Hedron Kerdos, the captain of the Wicked Wench, has dropped our party off on the docks of Targos.
He told us to seek out Ulbrec Dinnsmore, the Lord of Targos, in the town above the cliffs and warned us to be careful of the goblin raiders in the region.~
@745 = ~Ghost in the Inn

We asked Gohar if he knew Viera's husband, Donovan, and he said the man died years ago.
He still had a piece of Donovan's boat which washed up on shore, though, and he gave it to us.  We should be able to take it to Veira and set her heart at peace.~
@754 = ~Hedron's Mother

It wasn't until we mentioned Hedron's ship, the Wicked Wench, by name that the old woman we saved ceased her howling and reluctantly admitted we might be telling the truth about us coming to help her.
She told us to go back to Hedron and tell him she was safe.  Oddly enough, Firtha mentioned that she was blind, which is strange, because she seemed to see us quite clearly.~
@792 = ~Firtha's history

When we asked Firtha Kerdos about the troubles in Icewind Dale and the Ten-Towns some thirty years past, she related the following tale to us:

"Was the Year of the Cold Soul, and never a truer name been given to a year.  With the winter rushing in fierce out of the North and all, it must have lit a fire under some young fools' heads, because a band of 'adventurers'... pure-blood southerners, if there ever was... humped their way up through the Spine of the World and into the small fishing village of Easthaven, one of the Ten-Towns down to the south - along Lac Dinneshere.  They kicked up their feet at the Winter's Cradle Tavern, talking of fame and glory and this and that when those empty-headed fools got yanked into helping the local sword, Hrothgar, go on an expedition to the tree town of Kuldahar and see what was amiss... because there was dark things brewing like there always is, which means some fool's got to go plunge his sword into a few hundred beasties to set the matter right.

"Well, Hrothgar never made it, and neither did most of the expedition - except for this band of newcomers.  They were caught in an avalanche, hear told, and they dragged themselves into Kuldahar like a line of wet cats.  The winter had picked up, though, and the avalanche had sealed off the Pass, so there was no choice for them but to sit under the shade of the great Kuldahar oak and make do with what they could to solve Kuldahar's problems.  They nearly raised the hells themselves, the story goes, though I don't know all the particulars meself.  I heard some talk of tombs, and temples, and volcanoes, and dwarven deeps and severed hands, and ghosts and shades and all manner of horrid things - but in the end, they set things right, and the seasons resumed their normal heartbeat, and all was well... well, except for Kuldahar and Easthaven being a bit shabbier for wear than before, but that didn't last long."

"As most stories go, ye'd figure that'd be the end of it, and I'm sure those Southerners thought as much, too.  But no sooner had they saved the North from one fool evil then another popped up - a bad mix of barbarian blood and something that should have laid to rest at the bottom of Lac Dinneshere, that's what.  Some hide-wearing medicine man from one of the Northern tribes whisked those southerners right out of Kuldahar - walking right on the wind itself, it's said, and he took them to Lonelywood where he told them he'd had some fool vision of them heading off the barbarian invasion that was about to begin, then he left them to it, no doubt leaving them in the middle of town, blinking, with their mouths hanging open in the middle of that ramshackle logging town."

"Well, when put to the test, they didn't fail the North twice, and they sent the barbarians and a whole flock of evil terrors running and stumbled their way back to Lonelywood.  Last word of them was they were camped out at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, wondering whatever had possessed them to leave the Winter's Cradle in the first place, when some halfling showed up, telling them of some old ruined castle where there were riches beyond a king's dreams - all for the taking."

"The next morning, they were gone, no trace of them, just empty rooms and a tale from an old woman's lips."~
@797 = ~Goblins at Docks

We met with Lord Ulbrec Dinnsmore, the spokesman of Targos.
He was somewhat short with us, and he demanded to know what was occurring at the docks.~
@800 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We met with Shawford Crale, commander of the Targos Guard.
He told us to speak to Olap Tamewater, a dwarven engineer assigned to the Palisade and give him whatever assistance is required.~
@802 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

We returned to Shawford and told him that the Palisade had been repaired.
He thanked us and sent us on our next mission, to see the captain of the archers on the western wall, a man named Isherwood, and see about getting him a supply of arrows for his men.~
@961 = ~Garradun's Letter

We had gotten a letter from Garradun Tanner, a courier we met in Targos, written to his beloved Raina.
We delivered the letter to his commander, Captain Ingrath Mariner, just as he'd asked.~
@966 = ~Denham's Letters

We delivered Denham's trapped replacement for Garradun the spy's false love-letter to Captain Ingrath Mariner.
We also gave Denham's note of warning to Sergeant Rahm Dammel, the commander of the Luskan forces.~
@967 = ~Captain Ingrath

It turns out that the Captain Ingrath Mariner we met was actually a doppelganger in the employ of the Legion of the Chimera.
The doppelganger and its associates must have slain the real Ingrath and his men as they were on the way to the Western Pass.~
@1346 = ~Lost Cat

We told Firtha what happened to her missing cat, Loki.  She flew into a rage when she heard that Anson had kidnapped him, but we managed to calm her down.~
@1350 = ~Firtha's history

After Firtha told us the tale, she told us we might be able to find some interesting volumes in the Town Hall, in the keeping of Lord Ulbrec's wife.
She also cautioned us to check our journal on occasion, in case we lost our way and had forgotten some important tidbit that might give us a new focus.~
@1438 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We crossed paths with Lumbar Grundwall, a red-faced tradesman in the streets of Targos.
Apparently, he had been commissioned to deliver a load of lumber to the Targos Palisade, but he is short-handed and the crane that was being used to move the lumber up the cliff face has been damaged.  Looks like Tymora's being light with the blessings this day.~
@1439 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We brought Lumbar the wooden crane wheel to repair the crane.
He wanted nothing to do with it and told us to put it in the crane ourselves.~
@1476 = ~Wounded soldier

We arrived at Targos, only to find it being attacked by a group of goblin raiders.
We ran across a wounded soldier at the docks - he asked us to bring him a healing potion from the harbor master, a man named Magdar.  He said we could probably find him in one of the warehouses north of the docks.~
@1477 = ~Wounded soldier

We brought Reig a healing potion.
Hopefully, it should heal the rest of his wounds and allow him to get back on his feet.~
@1478 = ~Wounded soldier

We were able to cure Reig's wounds with our healing magic, but he still looked in pretty bad shape.
He asked us to find Magdar and bring him a healing potion.~
@1479 = ~Goblins at Docks

We told Reig that we had wiped out the goblins along the docks.
He told us to go see Lord Ulbrec in the town above.~
@1505 = ~Iron Collar mercenaries

The Iron Collar mercenaries mentioned there were two more in their band:
A priest named Koluhm Bonecutter who they said could speak to the dead, and the other was a wizard dressed in rags by the name of Phaen.~
@1506 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

By keeping a level head, 
we managed to convince the Iron Collar mercenaries to report to the Palisade for duty.~
@1548 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

With a choice turn of phrase, we managed to provoke the Iron Collar mercenaries into letting us make an example of them.
I doubt Crawford will have any more problems with any other companies on the Palisade after they hear about what happened at the Salty Dog.~
@2480 = ~Gaernat Sharptooth

We met Gaernat Sharptooth, a wererat, in Shaengarne Pass.
He claimed to be the ruler of the pass and any who dwelled within.~
@2481 = ~Wererat in Shaengarne

We met a wererat in Shaengarne Pass 
Who may well have been the leader of the forces there.~
@2482 = ~Gaernat Sharptooth

We met Gaernat Sharptooth, a wererat, in Shaengarne Pass.
He claimed to be the ruler of the pass and any who dwelled within.~
@2568 = ~Hedron's Mother

Turns out Hedron's mother lives in Targos.
Once he heard about the goblin attack, he asked us to go make sure she was safe.~
@2569 = ~Hedron's Mother

We told Hedron we'd rescued his mother from the goblins.
He thanked us for our efforts.~
@2571 = ~Hedron's Mother

We told Hedron his mother had perished in the goblin attack.
We didn't elaborate on the circumstances.~
@2703 = ~Lost children

Suoma, the elder of Wandering Village, has asked that we speak with and help Venla the Healer.
She claims that if we aid the village, she will aid us in turn, telling us the way through the haunted Fell Wood to the east.~
@2704 = ~Barrow Wight

After defeating Limha and recovering the missing village children for Venla
Suoma the Elder has asked another favor of us: she wants us to speak with and aid Tahvo the Huntmaster.~
@2705 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

We put the barrow wight Tahvo spoke of to peace and returned to Suoma, who had yet another request.
This time, she wanted us to speak with and help Kurttu.   For the sake of this village and of Kuldahar, we can only hope this is the last task she has for us.~
@2706 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

We spoke with Kurttu and uncovered the mystery of Kyosti's silent ghost.
This was the third and final task Suoma had given us; having aided the village to the best of our ability, she is now willing to tell us how to pass through the Fell Wood.~
@2707 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

Suoma the Elder told us the way through the Fell Wood:
Apparently, there is a sort of creature called a "dark treant" whose evil power can twist and hide paths and confuse travelers, causing them to become hopelessly lost.  If we destroy the dark treants of Fell Wood, we should be able to pass through it and to the Cold Marshes beyond.~
@2710 = ~Remains from the Fell Wood

We brought the remains of the Fell Wood dead back to the Wandering Village and gave them to Suoma the Elder, who will inter them.
We brought the remains of the Fell Wood dead back to the Wandering Village and gave them to Suoma the Elder, who will inter them.~
@2953 = ~Saablic Tan

Once again we faced Saablic Tan.  He seemed none too pleased that we successfully cleared out the Fields of Slaughter, and now he has vowed to halt our progress.  We cannot allow that to happen.~
@3003 = ~Clear the Fields of Slaughter

The cleric mentioned something about purifying the field with holy water during his argument with the lich. Perhaps we can carry out the task he sacrificed his life attempting, and rid these plains of the vile, walking dead.~
@3173 = ~Lost children

We went to Venla the Healer after defeating the diabolical witch Limha and freeing the village's children from her wicked grasp.  We should let Suoma the Elder know.~
@3175 = ~Lost children

Venla the Healer asked that we try to find out what's happened to the village's vanishing children.~
@3179 = ~Frostrose for Venla

We found some frostrose around the Cold Marshes and returned it to Venla.  In return, she gave us some medicine made with the stuff, and let us know that she'd be selling more of it along with her other herbs and poultices in the future.~
@3180 = ~Frostrose for Venla

Venla the Healer told us about a rare herb called "frostrose" that grows around the Cold Marshes.  She said that if we found some and returned it to her, she would give us some medicine that cures both poison and disease.~
@3191 = ~Lost children

When we asked Venla if there were any clues about the village's missing children, she said that their best hunters have searched everywhere and found no trace of them.  Some of the villagers feel that the children were lost in the Fell Wood to the east, having fallen prey to some "fey creature" like a dryad or nymph.~
@4403 = ~Barrow Wight

Tahvo the Huntmaster told of us a "furious ghost" that has been terrorizing their hunting grounds to the west.  Apparently they've slain it at least once, but it simply comes back every day.  There must be some way to get rid of it for good.~
@4404 = ~Barrow Wight

We told Tahvo that we'd appeased the barrow wight.  We should let Suoma the Elder know.~
@4406 = ~Barrow Wight

Based on Tahvo's information about their "furious ghost," it sounds as if the creature is a wight of some sort.  Perhaps someone stole something from its barrow - that would explain why it has come back to life and is attacking people.~
@4686 = ~Koluhm Bonecutter

We met a priest of Myrkul called Koluhm Bonecutter.  He is serving Targos as a mortician of sorts, and he claims to be able to speak to the dead as well as the living.~
@4733 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

Kurttu has asked that we help uncover the mystery of the disappearance of Kyosti and his silent ghost.  Kyosti vanished some time ago, but his spirit occasionally returns to haunt the area between the village and the Fell Wood to the east.  Since it won't speak, the villagers don't know why the hunter's soul can't rest.~
@4734 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

We explained to Kurttu that Kyosti was murdered by his wife Carita and that Leevi - her lover - had hidden the corpse, removing its tongue so that Kyosti's ghost could not speak to reveal their shame.  Leevi and Carita have vanished themselves, presumably fleeing the village after somehow finding out that I had discovered their terrible secret.~
@4735 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

According to Kurttu, the recently vanished Kyosti was Carita's husband and one of the village's best hunters.  Kurttu also claimed that Carita, his widow, said that when Kyosti disappeared, he had been going to the Fell Wood east of the village to hunt the huge white wolves that dwell there.  However, it seems that his body was never found.~
@4737 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

According to Kurttu, Kyosti's widow Carita always seems angry, even when she was with her husband.  Kurttu also mentioned that after Kyosti's disappearance, Carita turned to a man named Leevi for comfort.~
@4738 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

According to Kurttu, Leevi is one of the best hunters in the village.  She also mentioned that he and Kyosti were perpetually competing friends and rivals.~
@5061 = ~Jari's love

We met a young hunter named Jari who is in love with a woman named Anja.  Jari is troubled as he doesn't have the skills to best Anja's other suitors in a hunting contest, and without her father's permission, he and Anja will have to flee the village to be together.~
@5062 = ~Jari's love

We gave Jari a winter wolf's pelt that we obtained in the woods east of the village.  He's now certain to win the hunting competition, and Anja's father's permission to marry her with it.  Jari was most grateful, actually giving us a gift in return.~
@5063 = ~Jari's love

We sold Jari a winter wolf's pelt that we obtained in the woods east of the village.  He's now certain to win the hunting competition, and Anja's father's permission to marry her with it.~
@5132 = ~Sick Diviner

We came across a mumbling diviner in the Temple Pavilion.  He was barely conscious, and he was ranting about goblins, ravens, and other visions.  He looked ill, perhaps poisoned by a goblin arrow.~
@5665 = ~Barrow Wight

It seems that the barrow wight is out and about on account of a common thief - someone has made off with its favorite drinking horn, and it's doubtful that the spirit will rest without it.  If we found the horn, the angry spirit should stop haunting the area.~
@5666 = ~Barrow Wight

We found the barrow wight's stolen drinking horn on a thief's corpse in the woods east of the village.  We returned it to Sordirsin - his spirit was grateful and left with the horn, claiming that we could take whatever we liked from his now-vacant tomb.~
@6097 = ~Nym

We met a drow mechant named Nym in a small village.  He was waiting there for the military expedition from Neverwinter - the same one destroyed by the Aurilites at the glacier in the Western Pass - to arrive.~
@6099 = ~Path through the Underdark

The drow merchant Nym told us that the Eastern Pass was entirely blocked by troops of the Legion of the Chimera.  However, he explained that there was another route over the Spine of the World: through the Underdark.  We will follow the Black Raven River north to where it flows from the Spine of the World mountains.  There should be a network of caves there that leads to a monastery high in the mountains.  Beneath the monastery is an entrance to the Underdark.  From there we'll enter the ancient dwarven ruins of Dorn's Deep from below.  From there we can surface on the northern side of the Spine of the World.~
@6100 = ~Legion of the Chimera

The drow merchant Nym left the village, but not before issuing a vague warning about the Legion of the Chimera knowing of our meddling and taking pains to stop us.  He suggested that we not remain there long.~
@6157 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

After speaking with Kurttu about Kyosti's ghost, we tried to ask to Carita about her dead husband - however, she wouldn't talk with us.~
@6178 = ~Assignments to Showford Crail

Lord Ulbrec has officially welcomed us into the Targos Guard, and he has told us to report to the commander of the Targos Guard, Shawford Crale, for our assignments.  Ulbrec told us we could find Crale at the Palisade, just beyond the north gate.~
@6179 = ~Clear Shaengarne Bridge

Lord Ulbrec praised us for our efforts in defending Targos during the goblin attack on the Palisade, but with his praise came another mission: a goblin force has taken the Shaengarne Bridge to the south, a bridge that the Neverwinter reinforcements intended to use to reach Targos.  He wants us to travel to Shaengarne Bridge and retake it from the goblinoids.  He hopes our band can succeed where the Targos Guard cannot; only time will prove him right or wrong.~
@6181 = ~Horde Fortress

Lord Ulbrec heard of the destruction of Shaengarne Bridge, and he has determined that only if Targos can mount an offensive quickly can Targos hope to break the goblin horde before they strike the town again.  He has asked us to meet two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston, south and east of Targos and give them whatever aid they require to break the goblins' strength in the region.~
@6186 = ~Horde Fortress

Lord Ulbrec heard of our success in retaking Shaengarne Bridge, and he believes a swift offensive has a chance to break the goblin horde and drive them from the region.  He has asked us to meet two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston, south and east of Targos and give them whatever aid they require to break the goblins' strength in the region.~
@6187 = ~To the Western Pass

Lord Ulbrec heard of our success in infiltrating the horde fortress and defeating the bugbear chieftain, Guthma.  He thanked us for our efforts and gave us our next mission, which should prove somewhat less strenuous than the other suicide missions we've already taken.  He asked us to speak to Oswald Fiddlebender and have him ferry us to the Western Pass to rendezvous with the reinforcements from Neverwinter.~
@6231 = ~Severed Hand

We diplomatically worked our way past the Guard Commander in front of the Severed Hand entrance.  In addition, she mentioned that we should see the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xavier Torsend, as soon as we enter, so we may acquire a delegate pass.~
@6572 = ~Thvara Baelm

We encountered a cleric of Auril named Thvara Baelm.  It seems that while we were doing battle in the Western Pass glacier, she was gathering barbarian recruits in the east.  Our paths happened to cross as we made for the Eastern Pass and she was returning with a number of barbarians in tow.  Needless to say, the situation degenerated rapidly.~
@6594 = ~Wandering Village

We met a group of hunters while traveling towards the Eastern Pass.  They asked us to stop at their village in the northeast and speak to a woman called Suoma the Elder.~
@6957 = ~Priestess of Auril

We learned that three high priestesses of Auril lead a congregation to create the glacier during one of their festivals.~
@6983 = ~Priestess of Auril

Aurilite priests performing a ritual apparently created the ice storm that caused Oswald's airship to crash.~
@7235 = ~Ghost in the Inn

We told Cahl-Hyred that we had set the spirit haunting his inn to rest.  He was pleased by the news, though reluctant to reward us otherwise.~
@7236 = ~Ghost in the Inn

The innkeeper of the Weeping Widow at Targos told us that a woman's spirit haunts one of the upstairs rooms.  We offered to see if we could help him by putting the ghost to rest, and he gave us the key to the room upstairs.  He said she appears at night, so we should probably check the room then.~
@7237 = ~Ghost in the Inn

The innkeeper of the Weeping Widow told us it's possible that Donovan's ship wrecked up on the beach of Targos, and that we should check with Gohar at the Salty Dog Tavern - Gohar apparently keeps pieces of various ships and uses them to decorate the walls of the Salty Dog.~
@7238 = ~Bottle of Spirit

Apparently, Koluhm, the priest of Myrkul, paid Cahl-Hyred with an enchanted bottle of some sort, but Cahl-Hyred is too frightened to open it, let alone drink its contents.  We told him we'd see if we could identify it for him, and then bring it back to him.  One of the mages or priests in town should be able to help us.  Cahl-Hyred recommended Elytharra, the wife of Lord Ulbrec, and an enchantress in her own right.~
@7239 = ~Recruit training

We were able to give some basics in spearwork to some of the Targos recruits.  It should help them fare a little better on the battlefield.~
@7424 = ~Drink more Guthewulfe

Guthewulfe, a hulking northerner in the Salty Dog Tavern, has a standing bet: if someone can stomach more "braehg" - wild boar's blood mixed with milk - than he can, he'll give the victor his silver wolf charm.  The catch is, the challenger pays for every round of braehg...~
@7425 = ~Drink more Guthewulfe

We managed to choke down more braehg than Guthewulfe, winning his silver wolf charm.  It's doubtful the winner will be gaining any "girth on the arms and fire in the loins" anytime soon, but something about Guthewulfe's charm seems unusual...~
@7477 = ~Reinforcements from Luskan and Neverwinter

Sergeant Rahm Dammel intends to lead his Luskan troops north from the Western Pass to Targos, while Captain Ingrath Mariner will return to Neverwinter for badly needed reinforcements.  Ingrath said that he would later rendezvous with us at the Ice Lakes en route to the Eastern Pass.~
@7502 = ~Reinforcements from Luskan and Neverwinter

According to Sergeant Rahm Dammel, the city of Luskan finally decided to send actual troops to Targos - as opposed to simply shipping up willing mercenaries and adventuring companies - but only after Neverwinter agreed to aid the town with forces of their own.~
@7722 = ~Beodaewn's Cult

We encountered Beodaewn and his "companions" at a caravan arranged as an encampment in the foothills.  They were posing as innocent travelers, but when we saw through their deception, he revealed his real form as a "true" werewolf.  He claimed that people have sought him throughout all of Faerun to receive his "gift" of lycanthropy - that probably explains the strange collection of followers gathered around him.~
@7728 = ~Beodaewn's Cult

Beodaewn told us he can change form at will, but his disciples can only do it at night - perhaps they have a lesser version of his lycanthropy.~
@7747 = ~Barbarians' Gate

We met a pack of barbarians whose leader ordered our heads severed and placed before their "cunning Gate-of-Stone" - probably some sort of crude wall or other obstacle designed to hold up caravans so that the barbarians can waylay them at their leisure.~
@7890 = ~Bottle of Spirit

We identified Koluhm's ghost-touched bottle for Cahl-Hyred, only to find out that he didn't want it anymore.  He told us to take it to Elytharra, Ulbrec's wife, and see if she had any use for it.~
@8058 = ~Sick Diviner

When we administered Guthewulfe's braehg to Valin, he awoke, coughing and spluttering.  Looks like that shock to his system was just what he needed.~
@8059 = ~Horde Fortress

Valin apparently had fallen into a dreamstate while trying to scry the location of the goblin fortress.  Although he wasn't able to determine its location, he told us the goblin fortress would seek *us* out, whatever that means.  He also gave us a warning - that if we left Targos traveling on the sky, that we should be prepared not to return to Targos.~
@8067 = ~Horde Fortress

Valin apparently had fallen into a dreamstate while trying to scry the location of the goblin fortress.  He didn't seem surprised by the fact we had already found it.  He also gave us a warning - that if we left Targos traveling on the sky, that we should be prepared not to return to Targos.~
@8068 = ~Sick Diviner

Valin mumbled something about "braehg" when he spoke to us - apparently, he needs it for some reason.~
@8126 = ~Lost children

Limha, a woman we met in the wild east of the Wandering Village, has been stealing the village's children and using their energy to prolong her power and beauty.  The process drains the children of most of their souls, after which she turns them into minks and sets them free in the wild.~
@8127 = ~Lost children

According to Limha, if we slay her, the children that she'd already transformed into animals will revert to their original shapes.  We've often discussed the likelihood that her final thought was to regret telling us that.~
@8128 = ~Lost children

We came to Limha after speaking to the dryad Carynara and asked her of the village's missing children.  The witch tried to deny it, but a child suddenly burst out of a holding pen hidden in Limha's home and begged us to save him - a happy coincidence for all involved save Limha, no doubt.~
@8305 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

We found the corpse of Kyosti buried in a shallow grave east of the Wandering Village, where we encountered his silent ghost.  It turns out that Kyosti was murdered by his own wife, Carita, who then forced Kyosti's old friend Leevi to hide the corpse.  Leevi, fearful of Kyosti's return as a ghost, removed the corpse's tongue so that the spirit could not speak.  It didn't work.~
@8419 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

We met a spirit in the Fell Wood who warned us away, claiming that those who enter are doomed to wander its trails for eternity.  According to this ghost, the woods are impassable until the "terrible secret within the Fell Wood" is laid bare.~
@8420 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

The spirit in the Fell Wood couldn't tell us the forest's secret, but said that the answer was not within the woods themselves - that we have to search elsewhere.  He also rendered a few words of advice: that within the Fell Wood, westwards always leads to safety, that the longer we wander the more lost we'll become, meaning that we should leave and return if we become too befuddled, and that if we die here, we'll join the "Restless Dead of Fell Wood" - the angry spirits of those lured to their deaths by ghost-lights.~
@8421 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

We asked the spirit we met in the Fell Wood about the missing Kyosti.  He told us that if we would extinguish the ghost-lights and thereby put the Restless Dead of Fell Wood at ease, he would tell us what he knows.~
@8422 = ~Ghost of Kyosti

The spirit we met in the Fell Wood told us that Kyosti did not die there, but that he had seen a silent ghost floating over its shallow grave west of the woods - could it be Kyosti?  The spirit said that if we went there, the ghost might appear to us - we'll have to search the area between the Wandering Village and the Fell Wood.~
@8461 = ~Lost children

A dryad we met in the woods told us that she had seen a human woman taking children into her home.  The woman lives west of the wood, in the wilderness between them and the Wandering Village.  We'd best go investigate.~
@8462 = ~Lost children

A dryad we met in the woods told us that she had seen Limha taking children into her home.  We'd best go investigate.~
@8463 = ~Lost children

A dryad we met in the woods told us that she had seen Limha taking children into her home.  Since we've already slain Limha, perhaps we should return to the village to see if the children have returned.~
@8492 = ~Ghost in the Torture Chamber

We encountered a spectre in the torture chamber of the duergar outpost.  It seemed to be the anguished remnants of someone who'd been abandoned by friends and tortured death by his captors - it mistook us for companions of old and attacked.~
@8493 = ~Ghost in the Torture Chamber

We tricked the spectre into believing that the present duergar are the ones responsible for his horrible death.  The spirit promptly attacked them, seeking revenge.~
@8494 = ~Ghost in the Torture Chamber

After turning the spectre we encountered in the duergar torture chamber, we managed to calm the spirit.  It left of its own free will.~
@8597 = ~Kill the beasts

We lied to the duergar cleric Zama Rogadimne, convincing her the Barud Barzam had directed her to aid us.  She gave us healing potions of great power, but threatened to kill us if she found out that we'd lied to her.~
@8669 = ~River Caves

Dargab, the duergar slave-master, warned us to stay away from the dungeons.~
@8670 = ~River Caves

Dargab, the duergar slave-master, explained that we'd eventually need mining tools to get past the collapsed passage in the eastern river caves.  He told us to speak with Barud Barzam, the leader of the duergar complex.~
@9099 = ~Saablic Tan

We came across a Red Wizard of Thay named Saablic Tan.  He tried to prevent us from entering the Fields of Slaughter, saying something about us murdering his brothers and sisters.  His ramblings could not justify the actions of the Legion of the Chimera, so we pressed on through his attacking horde.~
@9176 = ~River Caves

Barud Barzam, commander of the duergar complex in the river caves, told us that we could take the mining tools from the storage area there.  He said that since the duergar had intended to clear the caved-in eastern passage themselves, they would be more than willing to give us the tools if we would perform the labor - a fair enough deal, it seems.~
@9177 = ~Kill the beasts

Barud Barzam offered us a deal - if we would clear the river caves of all monsters, he will reward us handsomely.  In addition, he'll let us rest in the complex so long as we're helping him.~
@9178 = ~Kill the beasts

We accepted Barud's offer to clear the river caves of all monsters.  We're to return to him for our reward when done.~
@9214 = ~Kill Black Raven Monks

Barud Barzam rewarded us for clearing the river caves with wealth and magical items.  He then made another offer - if we kill all the monks of the Black Raven Monastery, he will reward us even further.  Barud claims that the duergar lost both the outpost and the Underdark passage to the monks long ago; with the outpost secured, he now wants our help in recovering the passage beneath the monastery.~
@9215 = ~Kill Black Raven Monks

We accepted Barud's offer to kill all the monks in the Black Raven Monastery.  We're to return to him for our reward when done.~
@9216 = ~Kill Black Raven Monks

Barud Barzam rewarded us for killing all the monks of Black Raven Monastery with wealth and magical items.~
@9217 = ~Duergar complex

According to Barud Barzam, the duergar complex in the river-caves was founded more than a century ago by a group of cleric-led duergar.  The Black Raven Monastery was built some time later, and eventually came to blows with the duergar over control of the nearby Underdark passage.  Barud told us that the monks butchered the small duergar garrison and sealed both the outpost and passage.  He and his followers have come to the river caves to reclaim both.~
@9218 = ~Duergar complex

Barud told us that he intends to make the duergar complex a base from which to assault the Black Raven Monastery in conjunction with a second body of duergar troops.~
@9219 = ~Duergar complex

Barud told us that, now that we've helped him clear the river caves and eliminated the monks of Black Raven Monastery, he would be joining with a second body of duergar troops and reclaiming the Underdark passage.~
@9220 = ~Duergar Abilities

According to Barud Barzam, all duergar possess the ability to become invisible at will.~
@9327 = ~Allies of the Legion of the Chimera

We encountered an eccentric but powerful mage called Harshom in the river caves near Black Raven Monastery.  He'd been sent to kill us by the Hosttower of the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan.  They must be the allies that Isair and Madae spoke of in the Wandering Village.~
@9328 = ~Allies of the Legion of the Chimera

Harshom claims to have found us through the aid of Carita and Leevi.  The couple was slain and fed to the enchanter's beasts after they'd told him everything.~
@9329 = ~Allies of the Legion of the Chimera

It seems that Phaen of the Rags, who we met in Targos, was also an agent of the Hosttower of the Arcane Brotherhood.~
@9616 = ~Mercenary Mage

We met a ragged looking mage in one of the abandoned houses in Targos.  He didn't seem too pleased with us barging into his room. He looks like a mercenary of sorts, which means he probably was allowed to occupy the building as a temporary barracks.~
@9619 = ~Traitor's scroll

When the mage, Phaen, caught sight of our scroll that we had taken from the goblins, he attacked us, saying that he wished to see Targos fall - it seems he was trying to undermine Targos from within.~
@9620 = ~Phaen and his master

Phaen claimed he was serving a master named Harshom the Beastlord... and that Harshom himself was serving "others."  Phaen wouldn't tell us who Harshom's masters were - and chose to try to kill us instead.~
@9714 = ~Ghost in the Inn

Koluhm said he had taken up residence at the Weeping Widow Inn, but that the weeping of a spirit had driven him from the building.  He told us if we wished to speak to this apparition, we should go to her at night.~
@9718 = ~Phaen

Koluhm told us that his mage compatriot, Phaen, had strange loyalties... perhaps this bears further investigation.~
@9719 = ~Interrogate the dead

We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and he couldn't give us a translation of what the dead goblin he was questioning said, so we asked him to write down what he could and have it sent to Shawford at the Palisade.  Hopefully, someone there can make some sense of it.~
@9720 = ~Interrogate the dead

We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and he couldn't give us a translation of what the dead goblin he was questioning, so we asked him to tell us what it was saying, and we were able to translate some of it.  It sounds like the goblin tribe attacking Targos is only one of many tribes in the region - that's not good news.~
@9721 = ~Interrogate the dead

We spoke to Koluhm Bonecutter, and while he couldn't give tell us what the dead goblin he was questioning, we were able to translate for him, and we think we understood most of what it was saying.  It sounds like we should expect a three-pronged assault led by three different goblin leaders, and their attack was meant to coincide with the attack on the docks, so the Palisade could be in jeopardy right now.~
@9722 = ~Secret niche behind the fireplace

Koluhm told us that the dead townsman actually used to live in the house where Koluhm has set up shop.  Apparently, Koluhm was questioning the poor soul if he had any gold hidden in the place, and he discovered that the man had a secret niche behind the fireplace.~
@9727 = ~Secret cache beneath the floorboard

Under duress, Koluhm also told us that there is a ruined building in town with a secret cache beneath the floorboard.  We'll keep an eye out for it.~
@9728 = ~Bottle of Spirit

We confronted Koluhm on the real use of the ghost-touched bottle he gave to Cahl-Hyred.  It seems he didn't know it was ghost-touched, and he told us that we might make use of it by capturing the tears of the spirit in the Weeping Widow and taking them to the enchantress Elytharra, Lord Ulbrec's wife.~
@9831 = ~Nonin's Ring

Nonin, the monk that works in the monastery's kitchens, mentioned that he'd lost his father's gold and ruby ring.  He asked that we return it if we found it.~
@9832 = ~Nonin's Ring

We returned a ring that we thought was Nonin's to the monk, but it turns out that it wasn't his.  Not only did we get to keep the ring, but Nonin rewarded us for our honesty - he gave us a key to the monastery's locked storeroom, saying that there were some potions for us in an unlocked crate.~
@9833 = ~Nonin's Ring

We found and returned Nonin's ring - he rewarded us with some potions.~
@9878 = ~Eight Chambers

Bered, the librarian of the Black Raven Monastery, mentioned Eight Chambers on the second level of the place that were used to test the worthiness of potential monks or associates to the order.  A monk named Morohem - "Master of the Chambers" - oversees them.~
@9955 = ~Sersa's training

Sersa, the monastery's quartermaster, claims to have stumbled upon a mental wall with her training.  She can't increase her martial skills, but Svaltid - the monastery's trainer - won't spend any more time with her.~
@9956 = ~Sersa's training

We were able to help Sersa improve her skills by giving her some techniques to practice.  In return, she'll allow us to rest at the monastery at no cost.~
@9957 = ~Sersa's training

We told Sersa that we 'd managed to convince Svaltid to spend more training time with her.  In return, she'll allow us to rest at the monastery at no cost.~
@9994 = ~Sersa's training

We managed to convince Svaltid, master trainer of the Black Raven Monastery, to give Sersa the additional training that she needs to advance.~
@10025 = ~Thief in the Monastery

We encountered a "monk" named Ven who was actually a thief in disguise.  He's trying to loot the Black Raven's tomb, but needed someone's help to open the gate.~
@10026 = ~Thief in the Monastery

We agreed to help Ven loot the Black Raven's tomb.  He's supposed to meet us on the third level of the monastery when we finally get the gate open.~
@10027 = ~Thief in the Monastery

We refused to be part of Ven's plans to loot the Black Raven's tomb, and he gave us a ring so that we'd allow him to escape peacefully.~
@10028 = ~Thief in the Monastery

Ven betrayed us in the Black Raven's tomb, taking all the loot for himself and setting off the alarm.~
@10130 = ~Duergar army

We encountered a large force of duergar waiting outside the Underdark gate in the Black Raven Monastery.  Apparently they'd simply been camped there, waiting for the opportunity to storm in and attack the place.~
@10462 = ~Entry to the Underdark

A monk named Salisam told us to ask Aruma Blane, who controls the monastery, about accessing the Underdark passage.  He warned us that she would probably say no, but asked that we come and talk to him after speaking to Aruma, regardless of her reply.~
@10463 = ~Entry to the Underdark

Salisam explained to us that, if we found a way to remove Aruma from power, he'll allow us to face the Eight Chambers in an effort to become associates of the monastery.  When that's done, we'll be allowed access to the Underdark passage.  Salisam suggested that Aruma's turning against the archimandrite has something to do with Dolon Daemba, the envoy from Isair and Madae - that he's somehow corrupted her.  In any case, we're forbidden from attacking both Aruma and Dolon or speaking of Salisam's offer to anyone else - should we do either, the offer is negated.~
@10464 = ~Entry to the Underdark

We showed Salisam the letters we found in Dolon's chambers.  He suggested that we take them to Aruma immediately.~
@10465 = ~Eight Chambers

Salisam told us that, with Aruma removed from power, we were allowed to face the Eight Chambers - mastering them will give us access to the Underdark passage.  We're to speak with Morohem on the second level of the Monastery.~
@10466 = ~Entry to the Underdark

Salisam congratulated us as associates of the Black Raven Monastery, saying that the gate on the third level of the monastery - and thus the Underdark passage - was now open to us.~
@10498 = ~Thief in the Monastery

We informed the leader of Black Raven Monastery of Ven the thief's plans to loot the Black Raven's tomb.~
@10633 = ~Wine for Niles

We encountered a mercenary, Niles, skulking behind one of the bunkhouses at the Palisade.  He asked us to fetch him a bottle of alcohol.~
@10634 = ~Wine for Niles

After we refused to bring him any alcohol, Niles snapped at us, and we responded by ordering him back to his post.  Hopefully, our warning will keep him on the straight and narrow until the goblin threat is over.~
@10636 = ~Wine for Niles

We had a spare bottle of wine, so we passed it along to Niles.~
@10742 = ~Entry to the Underdark

Aruma Blane, leader of the Black Raven Monastery, refused to let us use the Underdark passage.~
@10743 = ~Aruma and Dolon

After showing Dolon's letters to Aruma, she has decided to leave the monastery in the charge of Salisam.  Oddly enough, it seems that she and Dolon Daemba - Isair and Madae's envoy to the archimandrite - have fallen in love and are running off together.~
@10744 = ~Thief in the Monastery

We informed the leader of Black Raven Monastery of Ven the thief's plans to loot the Black Raven's tomb.~
@10745 = ~Eight Chambers

After informing Aruma of Salisam's offer and winning her confidence, she has allowed us to face the Eight Chambers - mastering them will give us access to the Underdark passage.  We're to speak with Morohem on the second level of the monastery.~
@10746 = ~Entry to the Underdark

Aruma congratulated us as associates of the Black Raven Monastery, saying that the gate on the third level of the monastery - and thus the Underdark passage - was now open to us.~
@10747 = ~Dolon's letters

We showed Dolon's letters to Aruma, but she explained that she'd already seen them and then chastised us for having broken into Dolon's chambers.~
@10779 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

We returned to Shawford and told him that the only one who could have solved Olap's problem is dead.  He understood and sent us on our next mission, to see the captain of the archers on the western wall, a man named Isherwood, and see about getting him a supply of arrows for his men.~
@10780 = ~Interrogate the dead

We returned to Shawford and told him we had gotten Isherwood the arrows he needed.  He thanked us, and then sent us on our next mission.  He wants us to go speak to Koluhm in town, and find out what the Priest of Myrkul has gleaned from questioning a goblin's dead body.~
@10781 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

We told Shawford we couldn't go speak to Koluhm because he'd accidentally died while tangling with us.  We didn't say it exactly like that - after all, Shawford has enough to worry about without locking us up in the gallows.  He took it well, and he sent us on our next assignment; to go to the Salty Dog Tavern and haul those drunken fools that call themselves the Iron Collar Mercenary Band up to the Palisade.~
@10782 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

We returned to Shawford after speaking with Koluhm, and he sent us on our next assignment; to go to the Salty Dog Tavern and haul those drunken fools that call themselves the Iron Collar Mercenary Band up to the Palisade.~
@10783 = ~Defense of the Palisade

We told Shawford that the Iron Collar band met with an unfortunate... accident while we were attempting to get them to report for duty, and he took it all in stride, like it was what he expected to hear.  Odd.  No sooner had we told him the fate of the Iron Collar band, then we heard an explosion from outside, and the Palisade was under attack!~
@10784 = ~Defense of the Palisade

We told Shawford that we'd pressured the Iron Collar band to get their worthless hides onto the Palisade, and he seemed surprised and grateful at our efforts.  No sooner had he finished congratulating us when we heard an explosion from outside, and the Palisade was under attack!~
@10931 = ~Eight Chambers

Morohem has allowed us to face the Eight Chambers.  We must choose one of our number to enter alone and without equipment; he mentioned that Nonin, upstairs, can help us store any items that the others can't carry.  However, each chamber has a hidden compartment filled with weapons; they're opened by large golden buttons.  Morohem will let the challenger into each chamber in turn and seal the door behind him or her, at which point the test will begin - the challenger can't leave a chamber until he or she masters it or dies trying.  He also says we can rest here so long as we're facing the chambers.~
@10932 = ~Eight Chambers

We met Morohem, the Black Raven Monastery's Master of Chambers.  His duties are to guide challengers through the testing chambers, offering instructions and advice.~
@11464 = ~Isair and Madae

Isair and Madae, twin commanders of the Legion of the Chimera, appeared before us in the Wandering Village.  They claim to have found us with information purchased from Nym, the drow merchant who told us of the underdark passage beneath the Black Raven Monastery.  Madae claimed that the Legion would still attack Kuldahar, and Isair warned us to stop our "meddling," claiming that Targos wasn't alone in having Luskan allies.  To demonstrate his seriousness, Isair slew several villagers and raised them as zombies against us before vanishing along with his sister.~
@11522 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

With a choice turn of phrase, we managed to provoke the Iron Collar mercenaries into letting us make an example of them.  I doubt Crawford will have any more problems with any other companies on the Palisade after they hear about what happened at the Salty Dog.~
@11565 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

We found Isherwood at the western wall and told him that Crale had sent us.  Isherwood told us he needed three hundred arrows, and we told him we'd go to the Gallaway Trade Depot and see about having them delivered to the wall.~
@12735 = ~Repair the Catapult

We had a shock on the southwest Palisade - we came across a laborer named Caulder who *didn't* want us to fetch something.  In fact, he didn't want our help at all, which is a nice change of pace, except that his stubbornness may be putting Targos at risk.  Maybe a more persuasive member of our party could convince him to let us help him.~
@12736 = ~Trick a soldier

We convinced some moon-eyed soldier to leave a weapons rack unattended so that we might inspect it at our leisure.  He's bound to be wandering the Palisade forever, trying to figure out which one of the "captains" was looking for him.~
@12737 = ~Bet with a Soldier

We took a wager from a fellow named Gable at the Palisade.  He bet us that we couldn't knock a barrel from atop its perch on the wall... we'll see about that.~
@12738 = ~Bet with a Soldier

We collected on our bet from Gable, and I think we have dulled him of any desire to gamble in the near future.~
@13923 = ~Teaching Pairi

We met a young half-elven sorceress-to-be named Pairi en route to the Ice Lakes, and helped her to better understand her budding abilities.~
@13925 = ~Vunarg

We encountered this strange goblin chieftain named Vunarg.  He was well spoken and seemed concerned about his tribe.  We convinced him that he could do more for his people by going back to his homeland and grabbing as much land and resources as he could there.~
@14622 = ~Repair the Catapult

By calling on our persuasive abilities, we were able to convince Caulder... after much debate... to let us help him by fetching a hammer.  We're still debating the wisdom of our decision.~
@14725 = ~Repair the Catapult

By calling on our racial background, we were able to convince Caulder... after much debate... to let us help him by fetching a hammer.  We're still debating the wisdom of our decision.~
@14822 = ~Repair the Catapult

We brought Caulder a hammer and then watched as he attacked the nails on the catapult in a berserker frenzy.  The fellow must have some barbarian blood coursing in his veins.  Once he was finished, the catapult looked repaired... and frightened.~
@15154 = ~Goblins at Docks

We spoke to an elderly dwarf named Jorun Tamewater.  He told us he suspects goblin sappers tunneled into some of the old caves in the Targos cliffs and emerged on the docks.  If so, that means there's an opening to their tunnels somewhere around the docks - we just have to find it.  Jorun also told us if we got overwhelmed by any goblins to lure them back to him, and he'll help us defeat them.~
@15159 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We told Jorun the problem with the crane, and he gave us a spare crane wheel to fix it.  Apparently, all we need to do is simply place it in the crane, and it should work again.~
@15164 = ~Rest in Jorun's House

Jorun told us if we need a place to rest, we could hole up in his house just to the south and west.  He told us that he had a chest there rigged to spit out some gut-churning gas if someone tried to break it open, but a thief might be able to disarm the trap and get the weapons inside.~
@15592 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We came across Olap Tamewater, a dwarven engineer supervising the construction of the Palisade.  He told us to go find the Guard Commander, Shawford Crale, in the meeting house to the south.~
@15593 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We came across Olap Tamewater, a dwarven engineer supervising the construction of the Palisade.  We told Olap that Shawford has sent us to him, and he promptly enlisted us to help him repair a section of the Palisade wall.  Apparently, Olap has a supply of lumber in the main town, but it has yet to be delivered.  He told us to track down a lumber merchant named Lumbar Grundwall in the main Targos Town and see what's holding up the shipment of lumber to the Palisade.~
@15595 = ~Logs for the Palisade

Olap told us to track down a lumber merchant named Lumbar Grundwall in the main Targos Town and see what's holding up the shipment of lumber to the Palisade.~
@15694 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We returned to Olap and told him that we had fixed the crane.  He was too busy patting himself on the back to acknowledge our efforts.~
@15712 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

Through the threat of force and by explaining the dark side of human nature, we convinced Deirdre to ship the arrows to the Palisade where they were needed.~
@15713 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

We appealed to Deirdre's better nature, and she agreed to deliver the arrows to the Palisade.~
@15714 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

We paid Deirdre for the arrows with gold out of our own pockets.  I doubt we'll get any recompense from the Targos Guard.~
@15776 = ~Meal for Pondmuk

The goblin named Pondmuk, who we've encountered in the Goblin Warrens, has asked us to gather food for him.  In exchange, he offered to give us information.  He apparently has a fondness for some sort of big spider.~
@15777 = ~Meal for Pondmuk

The goblin named Pondmuk, who we've encountered in the Goblin Warrens, has asked me to gather food for him.  In exchange, he offered to give us information.  We told him we weren't interested.~
@15778 = ~Meal for Pondmuk

We brought the goblin, Pondmuk, food as he asked.  He, in return, offered up the password used to gain access to the door near the entrance to the goblin warrens.  The password he gave us was "Chimera."~
@15901 = ~Password "Chimera"

Near the entrance to the goblin warrens we used the password given to us by Pondmuk, "Chimera."  It worked, and the guard opened the door.~
@15928 = ~Trugnuk's Key

We talked to something named Gark that refused to open a fortified door near the Horde Fortress.  He did say something about a Chief Guthma, and that somebody, or something, called Trugnuk, has the key.~
@16061 = ~Ennelia and Braston

We came across an injured ranger scout named Ennelia who discovered the location of the horde fortress.  She is injured, but isn't nearly as bad off as her friend Braston who has apparently been taken captive... or worse.  It also seems there is some sort of drum-based alarm that the horde uses to alert its forces of an attack.~
@16063 = ~Ennelia and Braston

We've met an injured and helpless ranger named Ennelia.  Although injured, she's not nearly as bad off as her friend Braston who has apparently been taken captive... or worse.  It also seems there is some sort of drum-based alarm that the horde uses to warn its troops of an attack.~
@16064 = ~War Drums

The ranger Ennelia has encouraged us to destroy the drums the horde uses as alarms.  She believes this will make our exit from the fortress much easier.~
@16065 = ~Ennelia and Braston

The ranger Ennelia has charged us with saving her lover Braston.  We don't know if he still lives, but she believes he may be a captive in the fortress. ~
@16066 = ~Horde Fortress

The ranger Ennelia mentioned a locked gate to the east of her location.  Although she isn't sure, she believes it might lead to a network of goblin warrens that the horde could be using as barracks.~
@16067 = ~Healing Potion for Ennelia

To ease the burden of her wounds, we gave Ennelia one of our regenerative potions.  She showed immediate improvement.~
@16068 = ~Ennelia and Braston

We saved the ranger Braston and ensured his safe return to Ennelia.  They are off for parts unknown but showed their thanks with a gift and their blessings.~
@16069 = ~Horde Fortress

After defeating Guthma, Ennelia has reported that the horde army is already starting to fall apart.  She congratulated us on our victory and noted that our attack has crippled any further offenses against the Ten-Towns.~
@16652 = ~Kratuuk and M'darfein

We lied to the dread orc shaman, Kratuuk, and said that we were the war party sent by Saablic Tan.  He told us that an elven lich, named M'darfein, attacked his camp on a regular basis, and that we must venture forth and slay the lich.  He also gave us a key that will open a secret door in the northeast section of the gate that leads out to the ancient battlefield.~
@16653 = ~Escaped elven cleric

Evidently the dread orcs captured several elves, except for one, a cleric, who managed to escape.  Kratuuk instructed us to kill him if we find him, but we made no promises.~
@17060 = ~Logs for the Palisade

We told Olap that his father perished at the docks, and he dismissed us, telling us to go to Shawford for our next assignment.~
@18539 = ~A talking panther

A talking panther told us that she and her comrades will attempt to block our passage through the Western Pass.  They seem to be in league with whoever brought down Oswald's airship.~
@18557 = ~Caged Fury

We found one of Auril's altars in a secluded room on the bottom floor of the ice temple.  The altar contained the spirit of a tempest named Aeij-Kllenzr't who was pretending to be Auril, and we banished him from it by invoking his true name, Caged Fury.  He's been keeping the ice from melting, but he couldn't survive outside of the altar in his current form.~
@18561 = ~Beodaewn's Cult

A talking panther informed us of the presence of a cult in the foothills.  She said that they were led by a man named Beodaewn, and implied that they were half-man, half-beast.~
@18850 = ~To the Western Pass

Traveling in Oswald's airship to the Western Pass to find and meet with the military expedition from Neverwinter, we noticed a glacier blocking a large section of the pass.  We were immediately caught in a sudden ice storm that seemed to come from within the glacier, and crashed in the foothills that sit at the base of the Spine of the World Mountains.  We should investigate that very unusual glacier.~
@18851 = ~Boring Beetles

The crash knocked us unconscious, and we were rudely awakened by an attack of boring beetles.  Surprisingly, instead of fighting, some of them actually fled with some of Oswald's equipment dangling from their mandibles.  We should get that equipment back.~
@18852 = ~Boring Beetles

It seems a large tree broke the airship's fall when we crashed, unearthing a boring beetle nest in the process.  With the beetles living so close to the ship, they'll never let us safely rest inside or repair it.  We should either destroy the beetles in the nest, or the nest itself.~
@18853 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

Oswald's airship was badly damaged in the crash, and doesn't look like it'll be able to fly in its current state.  However, it's been a valuable ally in this war.  We should find a way to repair it.~
@18862 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

We found Oswald's equipment wedged in the side of a hole leading into the nest of the boring beetles that were attacking us.~
@18863 = ~Boring Beetles

It took awhile, but we defeated all of the beetles living in the nest near Oswald's airship.~
@18864 = ~Boring Beetles

We collapsed the hole leading into the nest of boring beetles near Oswald's airship.~
@18898 = ~Help Zack

We rescued Zack Boosenburry, a svirfneblin, by killing the remorhaz that apparently had swallowed him whole.  We're still not sure how he or anyone else could've survived living in that worm's stomach for days.~
@18913 = ~To the Western Pass

We told Oswald that Lord Ulbrec had asked him to take us to the Western Pass.  He told us we might never be able to return to Targos, and that we should take everything we need before we leave town.~
@18914 = ~To the Western Pass

Once we had our gear together, Oswald flew us to the Western Pass.  As we neared the Pass, however, the storms and winds began to pick up, buffeting the airship...~
@18915 = ~To the Western Pass

Oswald didn't awaken with us after we crashed in the Western Pass foothills.  He appears to be stuck in a trance.  Though his piloting skills are questionable, he's been very useful to us so far, and we may need to rely on his services in the future.  We should find a way to revive him.~
@18917 = ~To the Western Pass

After nearly losing our voices we finally awakened Oswald from the trance he was in after crashing in the Western Pass foothills.~
@19139 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

We agreed to retrieve the components required by Oswald's Mending spell so he can cast it to repair his badly damaged ship.~
@19143 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

After a wild scavenger hunt we finally found all of the components required by Oswald's Mending spell.~
@19272 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

Oswald cast his Mending spell with the components we found and told us that it would take time to complete.  Instead of waiting around, we decided to investigate the Western Pass further to learn more about what was going on.~
@20728 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

We ran across Isherwood again, and he gave us a couple bottles that he and his men had stashed away, as thanks for our efforts.~
@20730 = ~Arrows for the Palisade

Although it took some convincing, we told Isherwood he could take our arrows.  He thanked us and gave us a couple bottles that he and his men had stashed away, as thanks for our efforts.~
@20802 = ~Captain Yurst

Traversing the foothills, we came upon a wounded soldier from the Luskan militia named Captain Yurst.  Giants were pelting him with boulders from afar, and we agreed to dispatch them.~
@21668 = ~Captain Yurst

It was a challenge, but we prevented Captain Yurst from being stoned to death with boulders.~
@21669 = ~Captain Yurst

It appears that Captain Yurst has been badly wounded.  The harsh chill of the north has frozen him to the ground, and the fall he endured opened so many wounds that even healing can't keep them closed.  We agreed to find something to stop his bleeding.~
@21671 = ~Captain Yurst

We used a Periapt of Wound Closure to seal Captain Yurst's wounds and stop his bleeding.  While it healed many of his external injuries, his internal ones seemed much more severe... before he passed away, however, he told us he had been seized by a half-dragon woman and wyverns in the hills, and flown toward an ice temple in the mountains.  He managed to escape at the last minute, but the fall hurt him severely.  With his dying breath, he warned us of traps in the foothills placed by a strange group of rangers and druids in the region.  These should be removed or else they may pose a threat to the Neverwinter reinforcements. ~
@21698 = ~Aeij-Kllenzr't

We found one of Auril's altars in a secluded room on the bottom floor of the ice temple.  The altar contained the spirit of a tempest named Aeij-Kllenzr't who was pretending to be Auril, and we convinced him to leave.  He's been keeping the ice from melting, but he couldn't survive outside of the altar in his current form.~
@21724 = ~Aeij-Kllenzr't

We found one of Auril's altars in a secluded room on the bottom floor of the ice temple.  The altar contained the spirit of a tempest named Aeij-Kllenzr't who was pretending to be Auril, and Zack Boosenburry banished him from the altar by desecrating it.  The spirit has been keeping the ice from melting, but he couldn't survive outside of the altar in his current form.~
@21763 = ~Lord Pyros

Lord Pyros, ruler of the Dragon's Eye's magma chamber, grants everyone, including members of the Legion of the Chimera, safe passage provided they keep the peace and pay Archon his requested payment.~
@22009 = ~Priestess Cathin

We met Cathin, one of the three high priestesses of Auril, within the main chapel of the ice temple leading a collection of clerics in prayer.~
@22278 = ~Z'hinda Citadel

We met a strange brain creature in a vat at the center of the Z'hinda Citadel.  Though its telepathic speech was calm, it had no qualms about attacking us with powerful psionic abilities.~
@22313 = ~Ginafae

We met Ginafae Despana, a drider, in the northern section of the drider caves.  She seemed resigned to the destruction of the Viciscamera and the drider uprising.~
@22314 = ~Ginafae

We convinced Ginafae to leave the caves and return to her brother, Malavon.~
@22315 = ~Ginafae

We lied to Ginafae and told her that Malavon wanted her dead.  She responded by attacking us.~
@22419 = ~Making Driders

We met a woman named Imphraili Asserbai in a laboratory near the center of the drider caves.  She told us that she is a researcher for the school of transmutation.~
@22420 = ~Making Driders

We learned of an object called the Viciscamera that changes drow into driders.~
@22421 = ~Making Driders

We tricked Imphraili into telling us some of the weaknesses that the Viciscamera driders have displayed.  She told us that they are particularly vulnerable to electricity.~
@22466 = ~Dereth Springsong

We rescued Dereth Springsong, the Druid of Shaengarne, from a band of orcs on the river, and he has agreed to open the way to Shaengarne Ford for us if we will clear his home of orcs.  We have agreed to do so.~
@22511 = ~Malavon Despana

In the Underdark below Black Raven Monastery, we met a dark elf who introduced himself as Malavon Despana.  He told us that he is the Archmage of Sorcere, an academy of magic, and the patron of a dark elven house in the city of Rilauven.~
@22512 = ~Malavon Despana

Malavon Despana told us a bizarre story about his involvement in a civil war in the dark elven city of Rilauven.  Thirty years ago, dark elven rebels from the church of Vhaeraun enlisted Malavon's assistance in their overthrow of the ruling Lolth matriarchal theocracy.  Malavon's divination powers revealed that moving against the church of Lolth in their current state would result in his death.  Around the same time, a demon named Belhifet appeared above Rilauven in Lower Dorn's Deep, an abandoned dwarven city.  The demon, in the form of a priest named Poquelin, attempted to sway the drow of Rilauven into allying themselves with his army.  Malavon performed more divination and determined that allying himself with their cause would also result in his death.



Instead of facing death, Malavon chose to create a magical clone to serve as his proxy.  He explained his plan to his allies in the church of Vhaeraun and they helped him execute the procedure.  Using powerful magic, the church erased Malavon's memory of his divination about Poquelin and his subsequent decisions.  They replaced his memory with alternate images of success in Poquelin's army.  They then cloned Malavon and had his apprentice use a scroll to place Malavon's true form in a state of temporal stasis.  The clone awoke several months later, was falsely informed by the church of Vhaeraun, and sent on its way into Poquelin's army.



Only after a single week, the clone sensed what it was.  Unable to discern where its parent was located, the clone started losing its mind.  All attempts at finding the parent resulted in finding the clone.  In its pattern of investigation, it drew the attention of the drow of Rilauven.  Malavon's sister, Ginafae, was dispatched to "handle" her brother.  Unfortunately for Ginafae, even the simulacrum of Malavon's clone was too powerful for her to defeat.  Malavon's clone, in his demented state, handed Ginafae over to one of Belhifet's lieutenants, Marketh.  He also turned violently against his ally in Lower Dorn's Deep, the Red Wizard Saablic Tan.  He transformed Tan into an umber hulk and chased him out of the wizard's domed compound.  Malavon's clone's insanity increased over time, until he was reduced to babbling and lashing out gleefully at anything that came near him.  It was only after a group of adventurers destroyed Malavon's clone and the clone's simulacrum that Malavon himself was allowed to leave stasis.  The wizard remained in hiding for several months until he and the church of Vhaeraun overthrew the priestesses of Lolth and their supporters in Sorcere.  After the revolt, Malavon was appointed the new Archmage of Sorcere.  He attempted to find Ginafae, but was unable to locate her.  He assumed that she had been killed when Lower Dorn's Deep was overrun.  It was not until several years later that he discovered she had been transformed into a drider by malicious priestesses of Lolth.~
@22513 = ~Making Driders

After reporting the destruction of the Viciscamera to Malavon, he and his followers teleported out of the area.  Before he left, he told us that he believed a mind flayer could be found outside of the Z'hinda Citadel.  He stated quite confidently that harassing the mind flayer would cause the thralls inside to open the portals and surge out to defend the creature.~
@22747 = ~Illithid's Stone

We met a strange mind flayer by the steam pools in the Underdark.  Though it did not tell us its name, we somehow knew that it calls itself Oinchack'olp.  It seemed uninterested in what we were doing in the area.  It asked us to recover a stone for it, telling us that the stone was located in drider caves to the east.~
@22748 = ~Illithid's Stone

We returned Oinchack'olp's stone.  He rewarded us with a magical belt and then phased away.~
@22749 = ~Illithid's Stone

Oinchack'olp became angry when we refused to return its stone to it.  It told us that we would suffer greatly for refusing, then phased away.~
@22900 = ~Making Driders

Viizra Arabani, a drow priestess of Vhaeraun, told us that if we encounter any driders that all of the females are priestesses.  She also informed us that the males are evenly divided between warriors and wizards.~
@22964 = ~Sealed Doors

We entered the glacier through one of its many crevasses and came upon several ice doors indented with the emblem for Auril, Goddess of Cold and Winter.  All of the doors are sealed, preventing us from proceeding further.  We should find a way to open them.~
@22965 = ~Sealed Doors

Clutched in the frozen hand of a soldier from the Neverwinter militia was a holy symbol of Auril, and we used it to open the ice doors in the glacier.~
@22968 = ~Barricade

Advancing further into the glacier our progress was halted by a blockade of ice and hard snow that was guarded by a queen remorhaz and her Aurilite masters.  We should find a way to get through that blockade.~
@22969 = ~Barricade

It was a difficult battle, but when we killed the queen remorhaz the protrusions on her back became so hot that they melted the blockade behind her.~
@22970 = ~Barricade

Realizing it was the remorhaz's mating season, we led one of the males into the passage guarded by the queen, and she apparently became aroused upon seeing him.  As a result, the protrusions on her back turned so hot that they melted the blockade behind her.~
@22971 = ~Help Zack

We found a note hastily written by someone with small fingers on the floor of one of the crevasses leading into the glacier.  It appeared to be a call for help from "Zack" who indicated being stuck somewhere.  We should keep an eye out for him.~
@23111 = ~Send Puddy Home

We freed a gnome, named Puddy Talltale, from the torturing of a greater feyr.  However, even though we unlocked his prison cell, he said he would not leave unless there was a safe way to get him to his home in Bryn Shander.  We promised to find safe passage for Puddy, for we agreed that he would not survive long in the frigid Dales by himself.~
@23112 = ~Send Puddy Home

We were successful in finding safe passage for Puddy Talltale.  Orrick has offered to teleport him back to Bryn Shander.  Now all Puddy must do is sneak to the mage tower and find Orrick on the top floor.  Puddy reassured us that he would have no trouble sneaking over to Orrick, especially since he was a gnome and adept at that sort of thing.~
@23488 = ~Prisoners of Aurilites

Prisoners held in the Aurilite ice temple were being sacrificed to the Goddess Auril, but we found a way to set them free.~
@23489 = ~Nathaniel

One of the prisoners held in the ice temple told us Nathaniel, the druid we met from Kuldahar, was dragged this morning into a room north of the prison and hasn't been seen since.  Perhaps he's around here somewhere - if he's still alive.~
@23490 = ~Nathaniel

One of the prisoners held in the ice temple seemed to know us, and he told us a druid named Nathaniel was dragged this morning into a room north of the prison and hasn't been seen since.  The prisoner asked us to find Nathaniel - if he's still alive.~
@23531 = ~Captain Yurst

Captain Yurst asked us to remove the traps left throughout the foothills by the native rangers and druids, and we agreed to do so.~
@23696 = ~To the Western Pass

We met Nickademus, an arch-wizard who built the ice temple for Aurilite High Priestesses Lysara, Oria, and Cathin.  He failed to awaken Oswald from his trance, but told us we could do it if we went to Oswald and kept shouting his name.~
@23697 = ~Sleeping man

We encountered a man in a deep sleep in a bedroom on the ice temple's bottom level.  We were hesitant to wake him, but perhaps he'll be up and about if we return later.~
@23970 = ~Sherincal

We met Sherincal, a towering, female half-blue-dragon guarding the entrance to the Aurilite ice temple.  She claimed to lead the forces of something called the "Legion of the Chimera" in Icewind Dale's western region.  It appears the strange banners we've been seeing belong to them.~
@23971 = ~Legion of the Chimera

Speaking with Sherincal further we discovered that this Legion of the Chimera is an organization comprised of the disenfranchised freaks of Faerûn.~
@23972 = ~Isair and Madae

We also learned from Sherincal that Isair and Madae are twins who rule the Legion of the Chimera from its capitol, the Severed Hand.~
@24016 = ~Close Portal to Chult

We have broken the strength of the yuan-ti at the temple in Chult.  This should prevent them from reinforcing the yuan-ti at Kuldahar.~
@24120 = ~Nathaniel

We met Nathaniel, a druid from Kuldahar, who'd been locked in one of the ice temple's prison cells.  He asked us to free him before he suffered the same fate as his fellow prisoners, whatever that may be.~
@24121 = ~Nathaniel

We defeated Cathin, one of the temple's three high priestesses, and freed Nathaniel with the master prison key that she carried.~
@24146 = ~Nathaniel

We picked the lock on Nathaniel's prison cell door.~
@24147 = ~Nathaniel's Equipment

We agreed to find the equipment that was taken from Nathaniel by the Aurilites who captured him.  He said that it'd most likely be stored in one of the temple's treasuries.~
@24148 = ~Nathaniel's Equipment

It appears the Aurilites went through great lengths to keep invaders away from their treasury on the second level of the temple, but we found Nathaniel's equipment and returned it to him.~
@24153 = ~Aurilite Ice Temple

Nathaniel felt that the Aurilites were responsible for the cold and harsh weather in the region, and we agreed to investigate this matter.~
@24155 = ~Priestess Lysara

We spoke to Lysara, one of the temple's three high priestesses, who boasted that she'd been maintaining the glacier by sacrificing prisoners to her goddess Auril.~
@24156 = ~Lysara's Journal

We read the journal belonging to Lysara, one of the temple's three high priestesses, explaining that she'd been maintaining the glacier by sacrificing prisoners to her goddess Auril.~
@24158 = ~Aurilite Ice Temple

Once we knew the reason why the ice continued to reform over time and how to prevent it, Nathaniel asked us to defeat High Priestess Lysara, Cathin, and Oria, as well as destroy the altar they've been using in their rituals.~
@24159 = ~Aurilite Ice Temple

We finally defeated High Priestesses Lysara, Cathin, and Oria.  We also destroyed the spirit of a tempest bound by the god Talos into one of Auril's altars.  This spirit named Aeij-Kllenzr't, or Caged Fury, pretended to be Auril herself and demanded blood sacrifices from the sisters in order to maintain the glacier.~
@24160 = ~Western Pass

With the Aurilites no longer posing a threat, all that remained was to destroy enough of the glacier they created to open the Western Pass.  Nathaniel left to check on Oswald and fly to the Ten-Towns to warn them, promising to meet us in Kuldahar.  He asked us to use the fissure he would create to head south around the Spine of the World Mountains on foot, take the unguarded Eastern Pass to Kuldahar, and warn them about the collusion between the Aurilites and the Legion of the Chimera.~
@24161 = ~Auril's altar

Zack Boosenburry helped us desecrate Auril's altar the high priestesses were using in their ritual to maintain the glacier, but Nathaniel sensed that the desecration had no effect.  He wondered if perhaps there was another altar somewhere.~
@24162 = ~Nathaniel's Ring of the Ram

We found Nathaniel's Ring of the Ram inside the high priestesses' private treasure vault and returned it to him.  He planned on using his ring to help him destroy the glacier.~
@24163 = ~Nathaniel's Ring of the Ram

Even though we found Nathaniel's Ring of the Ram inside the high priestesses' private treasure vault, we decided to keep it for ourselves.  He planned on using his ring to help him destroy the glacier, but he said that his spells would suffice.~
@24164 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

We were unable to help Oswald cast his Mending spell to repair his airship, but we gave the components we'd collected to Nathaniel in hopes that he'd have better luck with it when he went to check on Oswald.~
@24165 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

While Nathaniel headed out of the ice temple to destroy part of the glacier and check on Oswald, we gave him items we'd collected in hopes that they'd prove useful in the repair of Oswald's airship.~
@24278 = ~Recruit blessed

We blessed some of Targos' new recruits, and set the fires of battle blazing in their hearts.~
@24279 = ~Recruit inspired

We inspired some of Targos' new recruits; they should face the battle to come with greater courage than they had before.~
@24280 = ~Recruit inspired

We inspired some of Targos' new recruits by showing them the hopelessness and desperation of their situation - and then showing them how much WORSE it could be.  The part where we elaborated on their corpses hanging from the bone trees in the fields of the dead seemed to hold their interest immensely.~
@24355 = ~Ilmater Sanctification Ritual

We have successfully completed the Ilmater Sanctification Ritual.  Already we can see a visible, cleansed change in the water that surrounds the statues.  In addition, we obtained a vial of the newly sanctified water, which we may use on the mythal.~
@24408 = ~Alliance with Iyachtu Xvim

We accepted an alliance with Iyachtu Xvim, with his vow that his demons within the Severed Hand will not aid Isair and Madae when we combat them.  However, in order to prove our allegiance to the Lord of Darkness, we must slay ten innocents.  He then told us that ten slaves within the Severed Hand would suffice.  A simple task, we believe.~
@24537 = ~Access keys to the Landing Pad

The War Tower gate guard, Stubnok, informed us that the only ones who have access keys to the landing pad are Captain Pudu and Captain Malign.  Stubnok also said that we could possibly find Captain Pudu on the top floor of the Officer's Tower, evidently entertaining one of the half-dragon delegates.~
@24561 = ~Access keys to the Landing Pad

We managed to trick Captain Pudu into thinking we were delegates from the Church of Iyachtu Xvim and needed access to the aerie in the war tower.  Luckily for us, he was in the middle of entertaining a lady friend and was all too eager to hand over his keys.~
@24562 = ~Access keys to the Landing Pad

We could not fool Captain Pudu into giving us his keys, so our only other resort was to kill him and his half-dragon friend.~
@24563 = ~Access keys to the Landing Pad

We found the captain of the guard attempting to have relations with a half-dragon.  Unfortunately for him, we had need of his keys and could not wait until he was done.~
@24633 = ~Get Nheero out of jail

A man named Nheero Fhutma was held in a yuan-ti prison on the first level of Dragon's Eye.  We agreed to find a way to open the prison's gate.~
@24699 = ~Severed Hand

We intercepted the half-dragon envoy.  Unfortunately, the escort guard arrived a few moments after we did, thus surrounding us between three powerful half-dragons and a battalion of Legion of Chimera guards.~
@24708 = ~Ormis Dohor

We found a lemure and three other monks in the War Tower's central jail cell.  As it turns out, the lemure was actually an archimandrite from the Black Raven Monastery, named Ormis Dohor. He said Isair and Madae, as punishment for not aligning with them, transformed him into a lemure. Luckily for him we found the antidote to remedy his condition.  As thanks, he has offered to help us in our upcoming battle against Isair and Madae.~
@24709 = ~We were not fooled

We found a lemure and three other monks in the War Tower's central jail cell.  He tried to trick us into thinking he was something non-threatening, but we were not fooled.~
@24710 = ~Ormis Dohor

We found a lemure and three other monks in the War Tower's central jail cell.  As it turns out, the lemure was actually an archimandrite from the Black Raven Monastery, named Ormis Dohor. He said Isair and Madae, as punishment for not aligning with them, transformed him into a lemure. He asked us if we could find the antidote to remedy his condition, held by one named the Tyrannar Brutai Mar.~
@24955 = ~Clear the Fields of Slaughter

We came across the waterfall the elven cleric mentioned in his argument with the lich, M'darfein.  We poured his holy water into the falls and could actually feel our entire surroundings change for the better.~
@24964 = ~Clear the Fields of Slaughter

We came across the waterfall the elven cleric mentioned in his argument with the lich, M'darfein.  This must be the place the cleric was to pour his holy water in the hopes it would purify the Fields of Slaughter.~
@24973 = ~Ilmater Sanctification Ritual

We met a cleric of Ilmater jailed in the eastern cell of the War Tower.  His name is Toral Sorn, and he was sent here to try and convert Madae back to her faith in Ilmater.  It did not work.  However, he said he had a second mission, which was to sanctify the waters of Severed Hand at Ilmater's statue in the Cleric's Tower.  He asked if we could carry out the task for him, now that he was too weak to carry it out himself.  We agreed and learned that we must gather four items to make the sanctification ritual work:  The Tome of Ilmater, which might be in the Mage Tower library;  Torals Bonds of Suffering, which were lost during a torture session;  Madae's Ilmater medallion, which we hope Madae still has somewhere in one of Severed Hand's many chambers;  and Tears of the Suffering, which we probably can get from a slave.  He then asked us to return once we have completed the ritual.



An additional note, Toral mentioned that performing this ritual might have a direct affect on the Globe of Essence; a device that keeps the glabrezu guards immortal.  Successfully performing the Ilmater ritual could make the globe vulnerable to attack, which would then allow us to permanently destroy the glabrezu guards.  ~
@24974 = ~Ilmater Sanctification Ritual

We successfully performed the Ilmater Sanctification Ritual and informed Toral Sorn.  He was very pleased with our accomplishment.  Hopefully this will help to turn Severed Hand against Isair and Madae.~
@24975 = ~Purifying the radiant pool

By purifying the radiant pool that Isair and Madae have been using for their own, twisted purpose, we should gain an edge in battle against them.  Already, the Severed Hand seems to be changing for the better.~
@25119 = ~Denham's Letters

Denham Fisher told us that Garradun Tanner, the love-sick soldier from Neverwinter in the pavilion, is actually a shapeshifter - a doppleganger spy.  The priest fashioned some replacement letters for us to take in case we meet the reinforcements from Luskan and Neverwinter.  He said something about the captain from Neverwinter being in for a surprise if he wasn't who he claimed to be.~
@25120 = ~Garradun's Letter

We told Denham we found some love letters on the shapeshifter's body in the Temple Pavilion.  The letters contained information on troop movements within Icewind Dale, but without knowing who the letters were intended for, we have no idea who the shapeshifter was trying to send them to.~
@25416 = ~Alliance with Iyachtu Xvim

We fulfilled Iyachtu Xvim's requirements for allegiance.  Now our battle with Isair and Madae shall be easier without having to deal with all their demons.~
@25437 = ~Alliance with Iyachtu Xvim

We accepted an alliance with Iyachtu Xvim, with his vow that his demons within the Severed Hand will not aid Isair and Madae when we combat them.~
@25735 = ~Clear the Fields of Slaughter

We found a waterfall that spilled into a pond that seemed to flow into some kind of underground stream.  We poured the holy water we found into the falls and noticed a calming change in the area.~
@25799 = ~TheTorture Chamber

Nheero told us that right before the prison gate opens he hears cries in agony and the sound of tendons being stretched beyond their limit.  He said the noise seemed to be coming from the torture chamber just beyond the prison.~
@25999 = ~Food for the Slaves

We met a woman named Vashti, the assistant foreman to the work crews.  It seems that someone is stealing food from the slave's food store.~
@26000 = ~Food for the Slaves

Vashti has asked us to speak to the cook about getting more food allocated to the slaves.  We have agreed to do this.  The cook can be found in the kitchen on the fourth floor.~
@26001 = ~Food for the Slaves

Vashti has asked us to speak to the cook about getting more food allocated to the slaves.  We are considering it.~
@26002 = ~Food for the Slaves

Vashti has asked us to speak to the cook about getting more food allocated to the slaves.  We refused.  We have other matters of importance to attend to.~
@26003 = ~Food for the Slaves

We told Vashti that the cook has refused to allocate more food for the slaves.  That being the case, we have been asked to find the food thief and put an end to the thefts.  We have agreed to do this.~
@26004 = ~Food for the Slaves

We informed Vashti that the food thief has been dealt with.  The slave food stores will no longer be compromised.  She was pleased.~
@26005 = ~Food for the Slaves

We informed Vashti that the food thief has been slain.  The slave food stores will no longer be compromised.  She seemed upset that about the death, but was pleased that the situation has been dealt with.~
@26057 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We met a man named Roga Thulc, the assistant foreman for the work crews.  It seems that one of his workers, Vylu Prehv, has gone rogue.  She is apparently pulling pranks using some earth elementals that she claims kinship with.~
@26058 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

Roga Thulc has asked us to convince Vylu to stop her pranks.  We have agreed to do so.  She can be found on the second floor of the Severed Hand, in the room next to the library. Oh, and he does not want her harmed.~
@26059 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

Roga Thulc has asked us to convince Vylu to stop her pranks.  We told him we would consider the matter.~
@26060 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

Roga Thulc has asked us to convince Vylu to stop her pranks.  We told him we had other matters at hand.~
@26061 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We informed Roga Thulc that Vylu Prehv was dead.  He seemed to take it rather hard.~
@26062 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We met with Roga Thulc after speaking with Vylu.  After hearing of her confused condition, he felt that she may be suffering from some mental ailment.  He suggested we speak with a priest in the infirmary about a cure.  The infirmary is on the fourth floor.~
@26063 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We informed Roga Thulc that Vylu Prehv has been cured of her ailment.  She has agreed to stop the pranks.  He seemed overjoyed.~
@26386 = ~Slaves in Severed Hand

We met Jerre Stoh, the slave foreman.  We had questions for him, but he refused to answer unless we told him who we were and what our purpose here was.~
@26387 = ~Unusual demons

We met Jerre Stoh, the slave foreman.  He told us of three unusual demons that inhabit the Severed Hand.  It seems that the creatures have been enchanted with immortality and can not be slain by normal means.  Two of the creatures act as guards for Isair and Madae.  The third guards the slaves and prevents their escape.  He suggested we search for the secret of these demons and learn how to defeat them.~
@26390 = ~Unusual demons

Jerre Stoh, the slave foreman, asked a boon of us.  When we learn the secret of the demons, and how to defeat them, he asked that we slay the demon guarding the slaves.  This would grant them their freedom.  A reasonable request.~
@26391 = ~Slaves in Severed Hand

Having discovered the secret of the immortal demons, we slew the one guarding the slaves.  They are now free.~
@26392 = ~Slaves in Severed Hand

Having discovered the secret of the immortal demons, we slew the one guarding the slaves.  However, Jerre Stoh declines to leave.  He feels that he may still serve some purpose here at the Severed Hand.  What, we do not know.~
@26394 = ~Ilmater Sanctification Ritual

We spoke with Jerre Stoh about the Tears of Suffering.  It seems that it was his purpose to grant them to us.  Now he is free to leave with the rest of the slaves.~
@26486 = ~Unusual demons

A demon stands watch at the exit to the Severed Hand.  We questioned the creature about its name and purpose, but it refused to answer.  In any case, the creature does not seem to be hostile.  Perhaps we should look into what purpose it serves.~
@26487 = ~Slaves in Severed Hand

Jerre Stoh claims that the demon at the exit is there to prevent the slaves from escaping.  We confronted the demon with this, and it confirmed it.~
@26488 = ~Unusual demons

Jerre Stoh claims that the demon at the exit is immortal and cannot be slain.  We confronted the demon with this, and it confirmed it.  This could be idle boasting on the creature's part, but Jerre claims to have seen the creature slain only to rise again.  Should we put this to the test?~
@26489 = ~Unusual demons

We asked the demon to name the power that spawned it.  It answered: Iyachtu Xvim, Godson of Bane.~
@26490 = ~Unusual demons

We decided to put the demon's claim of immortality to the test.  After the battle the creature did indeed rise again.  We need to find a way to put an end to this creature and any others like it.~
@26576 = ~Disappointed Priest

We met a priest of Iyachtu Xvim named Drothan.  He claimed that he was becoming disillusioned with the church and losing his faith.  Perhaps he would be willing to answer some questions.~
@26590 = ~Special holy symbols

According to Drothan, there are special holy symbols that give access to the priest's chambers in the Cleric's Tower.~
@26591 = ~Globe of Essence

Drothan told us about an artifact called the Globe of Essence.  This globe contains the life force of three special demons.  So long as the globe is intact, the demons cannot be slain.~
@26592 = ~Unusual demons

We have learned that two of the immortal demons act as guards for Isair and Madae.  The third is a guard that prevents the slaves from escaping.~
@26593 = ~Globe of Essence

We asked Drothan how to destroy the Globe of Essence.  He does not know how this can be accomplished, but he told us of a priest of Ilmater who may be able to help us.  The priest is imprisoned in one of the towers.  The globe is located in a temple on the second floor of the Severed Hand.~
@27058 = ~Severed Hand Delegate Pass

We spoke with the priest, Eradru, in the infirmary.  We asked for healing, but he refused us.  It seems we need a pass from Xavier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  We will need to look into this.~
@27060 = ~Severed Hand Delegate Pass

We spoke with the priest, Eradru, in the infirmary.  We asked if we could rest, but he refused us.  It seems we need a pass from Xavier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  We will need to look into this.~
@27061 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We spoke with the priest, Eradru in the infirmary about Vylu.  He gave us a potion that may cure her condition.~
@27313 = ~Imphraili's Laboratory

We used the white wyrm's egg to create two potions of strength.~
@27322 = ~Imphraili's Laboratory

We used the white wyrm's egg to form a magical liquid which was then mixed into the transmuter's bloodstream.  The process cooled the blood, making the transmuter resistant to cold but more vulnerable to heat.~
@27325 = ~Modified Golem

We found an inanimate flesh golem.  It seems to have been somehow modified.~
@27327 = ~Modified Golem

Imphraili's inanimate enhanced flesh golem is now ready to be awakened via an electrical blast.~
@27591 = ~Wounded soldier

We found the harbor master, Magdar Shenlen, in one of the warehouses along the docks.  He told us that there was a supply of healing potions in one of the barrels or crates in the warehouse, but he didn't know which one.  He mentioned that most of the supplies in the warehouse were under the protection of the Gallaway Coster, but considering the goblin attack, he put the supplies at our disposal and told us to take what we need.~
@27682 = ~Goblins at Docks

We encountered a soldier named Brogan along the docks.  He had cornered a small band of goblins within a warehouse, and he asked us to go fetch reinforcements from the Salty Dog tavern - apparently, there is an adventuring company called the Iron Collar Mercenaries holed up there, and he is in need of their extra swords to drive the goblins out.~
@27683 = ~Goblins at Docks

We returned to Brogan and told him the Iron Collar Mercenaries wouldn't be coming to help, and we offered our services.~
@27684 = ~Goblins at Docks

We convinced Brogan to let us drive the goblins out of the warehouse.  He told us they had locked themselves inside, and we'd need to break down the door to the warehouse with our weapons, or else we'd need to get a thief to pick the lock.~
@27685 = ~Goblins at Docks

We cleaned out the goblins in the caves beneath the warehouse for Brogan.  He seemed impressed, and he told us we should seek out Lord Ulbrec in the town above to claim our reward.~
@27686 = ~Goblins at Docks

We told Brogan we would go find the Iron Collar mercenaries... they're holed up in a tavern called the Salty Dog somewhere south along the docks.~
@27775 = ~Fake drawings

We met a slave girl named Ysha.  It seems that she delivered the wrong set of plans to one of the construction crews.  As a result, an area on the first floor of the fortress was reconstructed incorrectly.  We offered to help her by altering the plans to fit the construction that was done.  A deceit maybe, but one that could save her life and the lives of the work crew.~
@27776 = ~Fake drawings

We returned the altered plans to Ysha.  She was grateful for our aid.~
@27866 = ~Goblins at Docks

We managed to drive the last of the goblins off of the Targos Docks.  Reig and Lord Ulbrec should be grateful to hear of our success.~
@27867 = ~Logs for the Palisade

Using the flywheel from Jorun, we snapped it into place on the crane and got it working again.  Olap should have no lack of lumber from the docks from now on.  We'd best go tell him or Shawford what we've accomplished.~
@27868 = ~Defense of the Palisade

With aid from the Targos Guard, we managed to turn back the goblin attack on Targos and slaughter the goblin leaders.  We should tell Shawford or Ulbrec of our success.~
@27883 = ~Clear Shaengarne Bridge

We have accomplished our mission.  Let us head back to Targos.~
@27939 = ~Meeting with Isair and Madae

A half-drow named Buvai de'Naly intercepted us as we were descending through the War Tower.  Evidently we caused enough destruction in Severed Hand to warrant an audience with Isair and Madae, and Buvai was sent to be our escort.~
@28048 = ~Ghost in the Inn

Through faith alone, our priest broke the will of the spirit from the Weeping Widow Inn and extracted a strange premonition from it.  The defeated spirit warned us of the "sign of the chimera," and said this sign threatened all of Targos.~
@28049 = ~Ghost in the Inn

Through faith alone, our priest exorcised the spirit from the Weeping Widow tavern.  The innkeeper should be pleased to hear his inn is haunted no longer.~
@28050 = ~Bottle of Spirit

After extracting one of her tears and placing it within the ghost-touched vial, our priest banished the spirit haunting the Weeping Widow.  The innkeeper should be pleased to hear it... and we hope the reward has made our efforts worthwhile.  If not, at least we can sell the tear to Elytharra.~
@28051 = ~Secret cache beneath the floorboard

We were smart enough to coax a further boon from the spirit that led us to uncover a treasure cache beneath the floorboards of the Weeping Widow Inn.~
@28052 = ~Ghost in the Inn

We returned to Veira with the piece of Donovan's ship.  It seemed to set her mind at ease.  In return for our effort, she warned us of a great darkness that threatened Targos - an evil force gathered beneath the "sign of the chimera."~
@28053 = ~Bottle of Spirit

Using the ghost-touched bottle, we were able to hold one of Veira's ghostly tears.  Perhaps Elytharra can make some use of it.  Once we had obtained the tear, Veira left us at last, returning back to death from which she came.~
@28054 = ~Ghost in the Inn

We met a spirit haunting the Weeping Widow who was mourning her lost husband, Donovan.  Perhaps the innkeeper will know who this man is.~
@28151 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

By threatening to link the Iron Collar band to Phaen's treachery, we managed to convince the Iron Collar mercenaries to report to the Palisade for duty.  ~
@28186 = ~Clear Shaengarne Bridge

We managed to destroy the dam spanning the Shaengarne River today.  It was a difficult, but exhilarating experience.~
@28450 = ~Garradun's Letter

At the Targos Pavilion, a wounded scout named Garradun Tanner asked us to take a letter to Captain Mariner, the commander of the relief forces from Neverwinter.  Garradun seems pessimistic about his chances for survival, and wrote this love letter for his bride-to-be.~
@28451 = ~Traitor Garradan

We confronted Garradun on his attempts to spy on Targos, and he dropped his fa硤e and attacked us - unfortunately for him.~
@28602 = ~Tyrannar Brutai Mar's lair

We gained access to the Tyrannar Brutai Mar's lair, where the Tyrannar himself, and three of his Ruinlords, attacked us.~
@28780 = ~Illium and Goublika

Illium was about to launch an attack on Goublika when we told him that we had already killed him.~
@28781 = ~Illium and Goublika

Illium was about to launch an attack on Goublika when we told him that he wouldn't be disturbed, since we had already browbeat the giant into submission.~
@28782 = ~Illium and Goublika

Illium was about to launch an attack on Goublika when we persuaded him to break the cycle of violence.~
@28783 = ~Passage through the village of Andora

Illium Ar'Ghrenoir granted us safe passage through his hamlet Andora, but said that we would receive no further assistance from them.~
@28785 = ~Illium and Goublika

We waited on the ledge overlooking Andora while Illium launched an attack on Goublika.~
@28813 = ~Kill Black Raven Monks

We slew the last of the Black Raven Monastery monks.  We should return to Barud Barzam in the duergar's river-cave outpost to collect our reward.~
@28868 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

As soon as we had landed in Kuldahar, we were greeted by an emissary of the Legion of the Chimera, a neo-orog priest of Bane called Hiepherus.  He claims all of Kuldahar for his own, and he has raised undead monsters to seal off Kuldahar Pass.~
@28869 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

We managed to trick Hiepherus into revealing his plans for Kuldahar - apparently, his mission is to foster terror in the Pass, so much so that the archdruid Iselore is forced to leave the protection of the Heartstone Gem.~
@28870 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

Hiepherus seems to have some other reason for lairing within the Pass - but we could not find out why.  Apparently, Bane has tasked the priest with some mission, one that doesn't involve the Legion of the Chimera.  Perhaps their goals of the Black Lord and the Legion are not one and the same.~
@28871 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

We tricked Hiepherus into believing there was a two-pronged counterattack on Kuldahar.  He recalled away to check on his forces - I doubt we've seen the last of him, however.~
@28907 = ~Sheemish and Conlan

We told Conlan we'd found Sheemish in Orrick's Tower, and that he couldn't leave because he was still searching the place for hidden magic items.~
@28908 = ~Sheemish and Conlan

We told Conlan we'd found Sheemish in Orrick's Tower, but we neglected to mention the fact we killed him.~
@28909 = ~Tower Key

We asked Conlan about Gerbash, and he hadn't seen him - but he said there was a commotion in eastern Kuldahar not long ago, and perhaps Gerbash had gotten into a battle with some yuan-ti.  We may find some trace of him there.~
@29008 = ~Oria's Staff

Investigating the glacier and its Aurilian temple of ice we came upon a Marid Djinni Shaman-Lord named Ondabo.  Though difficult to deal with, he did tell us what happened to High Priestess Oria after she broke her staff.  According to him, she's crossed into a section of the ethereal realm located in the same space as the temple's lower level.  To reach this realm we'll need to find a room on that level with a checkered floor that she frequents.  As for what to do when we find it, we've no idea.~
@29165 = ~Kill the beasts

We slew the last of river-cave monsters for Barud Barzam in the duergar outpost.  We should return to him to collect our reward.~
@29233 = ~Repair Oswald's ship

A ranger named Illium Ar'Ghrenoir told us that he had belladonna, but since it was scarce this time of year, he'd neither sell nor trade it.~
@29273 = ~Close Portal to Chult

The Archdruid of Kuldahar, Iselore, asked us to help stop an impending threat to the village and its great oak.  He believes that yuan-ti from Dragon's Eye have opened a magical "crossroad" to a jungle in Chult, far to the south.  He asked that we find a way to seal the portal from the other side.  This involves slaying the "guardian" of the crossroads.  Iselore believes that the yuan-ti are probably protecting the guardian to insure that this does not happen.~
@29274 = ~Dragon's Eye

Iselore told us that the Legion of the Chimera forces are using Dragon's Eye as a route to Kuldahar.  He believes that at the base of the Dragon's Eye volcano, we will be able to enter the Fields of Slaughter.  From there, we can access the Severed Hand.~
@29429 = ~Iron Collar mercenaries

Black Geoffrey made his way to the Palisade right before the goblins struck, and it looks like his blade was able to cut down some goblins before the battle was over.  He told us he was striking out for Luskan, overland if need be, and we'd see no more of him... I don't know about his band.~
@29529 = ~Food for the Slaves

We spoke with the cook about getting more food for the slaves, but she would not listen to us.  We should speak with Vashti again.  Maybe there is another solution to this problem.~
@29990 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We spoke with Vylu Prehv.  She seems to be suffering from some sort of mental disorder.  She is incoherent to say the least.  We should speak with Roga Thulc about her.~
@29991 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We gave Vylu the potion provided by the priest Eradru.  It has cured her of her ailment.~
@30174 = ~Artifact guardian

We spoke with a priest named Garuk Katah.  He said that he was a guardian for a holy artifact of Iyachtu Xvim.  However, he would not reveal what the artifact does.  The artifact itself was a large stone with a pulsing purple glow.  It sits upon a pedestal in the middle of the shrine.~
@30278 = ~Are we test subjects?

We think we were just used as test subjects in some sort of examination.  We came upon two mages who appeared to be menaced by a demon.  After the battle, the mages began to discuss the merits of the creatures, and whether or not some sort of test had been passed.  They then teleported away to celebrate the promotion of the junior mage to the status of apprentice.~
@30317 = ~Portals puzzle

We spoke with Vese Nejj, a Thayvian mage.  He asked us to find a solution to a portal puzzle.  It seems that the Mage's Tower can only be accessed via a series of portals.  These portals need to be activated in a certain order.  We have agreed to do this.  If we are successful, we will be offered membership in the enclave.~
@30318 = ~Portals puzzle

We spoke with Vese Nejj, a Thayvian mage.  He asked us to find a solution to a portal puzzle.  We are considering aiding him.~
@30319 = ~Portals puzzle

We spoke with Vese Nejj, a Thayvian mage.  He asked us to find a solution to a portal puzzle.  We refused.~
@30320 = ~Portals puzzle

We solved the portal puzzle and gained entry to the Mage's Tower.  We met with Vese Nejj and gave him the solution to the puzzle.  It was our understanding that we were to be offered membership in the enclave upon completing this quest.  However, we were given yet another quest instead.  We are to enter the tower and steal three items housed there.  Larrel's bones, the Book of the Mythal, and Orrick's spellbook are the items.  We have reluctantly agreed to do this.~
@30321 = ~Portals puzzle

We solved the portal puzzle and gained entry to the Mage's Tower.  We met with Vese Nejj and gave him the solution to the puzzle.  It was our understanding that we were to be offered membership in the enclave upon completing this quest.  However, we were given yet another quest instead.  We are to enter the tower and steal three items housed there.  Larrel's bones, the Book of the Mythal, and Orrick's spellbook are the items.  We told him that we would take the matter under consideration.~
@30322 = ~Portals puzzle

We returned to Vese Nejj with the items that he requested.  When we asked about membership in the enclave, we were refused.  It seems he had no intention of ever allowing us into the enclave.~
@30324 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with Vese Nejj about the murder of Zaem Astyr.  He seemed satisfied that the matter had been handled.~
@30325 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with Vese Nejj about the murder of Zaem Astyr.  He agreed with us that Cedrin Zil was indeed his murderer.  Vese handled the matter himself and slew Cedrin for his crime.~
@30326 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We informed Vese Nejj that Cedrin Zil had murdered Zaem Astyr.  This matter is now closed.~
@30653 = ~Mezro Warriors

We met a man in the jungle leading a pack of warriors.  He told us that the yuan-ti have a temple to the southwest, called the Serpent's Lair.  The man described the temple as a dangerous place, though he also implied that deception may be the best way to avoid death in its depths.~
@31048 = ~Hellhole

A duergar artisan showed us a sort of automated heavy crossbow known as a Hell Bolter.  Its loading and firing mechanism was too complex to be understood by most.~
@31049 = ~Hellhole

A duergar artisan is trying to design a simplified version of his overly-complex Hell Bolter.  We might be able to help him.~
@31050 = ~Hellhole

We helped a duergar artisan finish the design of the Doom Bolter, an automated heavy crossbow.  He told us that he would sell us one if we were interested.~
@31051 = ~Hellhole

We helped a duergar artisan finish the design of the Doom Bolter, an automated heavy crossbow, in return for a copy of the weapon for ourselves.~
@31052 = ~Hellhole

We helped a duergar artisan finish the design of the Doom Bolter, an automated heavy crossbow, in return for five thousand gold pieces.  He told us that he would sell us one if we were interested.~
@31053 = ~Hellhole

We helped a duergar artisan finish the design of the Doom Bolter, an automated heavy crossbow, in return for seven thousand gold pieces.  He told us that he would sell us one if we were interested.~
@31180 = ~The mistress of the Viper's Fangs

The mistress of the Viper's Fangs, a sect of yuan-ti assassins, claimed that if we speak to her again she'd have us killed.~
@31234 = ~Coiled Cabal

A yuan-ti sorcerer of the Coiled Cabal explained the greater significance of this temple: it is a fortress that guards the crossroads back to Kuldahar.  If we can locate the five missing stone stele - some of which are hidden around the temple and in the jungle outside - and place them around the altar outside, the crossroads' guardian will be summoned: the Black Serpent Chahopek.  When Chahopek is slain, the portal will slowly begin to close; once it collapses entirely, it will never open again.  Needless to say, we'll have to be quick about getting back through the portal if we manage to kill this Black Serpent...~
@31269 = ~Coiled Cabal

We chose to fight a magical duel with one of Inhatri's Coiled Cabal sorcerers.~
@31270 = ~Coiled Cabal

We defeated one of Inhatri's Coiled Cabal sorcerers in a duel.~
@31312 = ~Treasury riddle

A yuan-ti assassin of the Viper's Fangs explained the temple treasury's locking mechanism to us.  There are eleven plates, ten of which must be depressed in the correct order to unseal the chamber.~
@31313 = ~Treasury riddle

The first half of the temple treasury's combination is to open the tenth plate, then the third, and then the fifth.~
@31418 = ~Put the guards to sleep

We spoke with a drow rogue by the name of Riki.  She warned us of a guard barracks on the fourth floor of the Severed Hand.  She feels that there are too many guards to defeat in combat.  She suggested using a powerful sleep potion on their food supply.  We have agreed to do this.~
@31419 = ~Poison the guards

We spoke with a drow rogue by the name of Riki.  She warned us of a guard barracks on the fourth floor of the Severed Hand.  She feels that there are too many guards to defeat in combat.  She suggested using a powerful poison potion on their food supply.  We have agreed to do this.~
@31420 = ~Put the guards to sleep

Riki gave us the recipe for a sleeping potion.  We need to find a virulent agent, a bonding agent, and tainted demon's blood.  We can combine these ingredients using an alchemy laboratory.  Riki says that such a laboratory exists in the Thayvian enclave on the second floor of the Severed Hand.~
@31421 = ~Poison the guards

Riki gave us the recipe for a poison potion.  We need to find a virulent agent, a bonding agent, and demon's blood.  We can combine these ingredients using an alchemy laboratory.  Riki says that such a laboratory exists in the Thayvian enclave on the second floor of the Severed Hand.~
@31422 = ~Cabal of Dragonkin

We spoke with a drow rogue by the name of Riki.  She warned us of a potential alliance between the Cabal of Dragonkin and Isair and Madae.  An envoy from the Cabal will be arriving at the Severed Hand soon.  We have decided to intercept this envoy and prevent this alliance.  The envoy will arrive at the aerie atop the War Tower.~
@31423 = ~The plan succeeded!

We informed Riki that we have dealt with the guard barracks.~
@31584 = ~Abishai

In a lair within the ice temple we encountered a group of white abishai lead by one called Xhaan.  He claimed they were under the mind control of a voice, near but distant, named Aeij-Kllenzr't.  He said the presence owning this voice was greater than Auril, and that it was forcing them into a berserker rage at the smell of blood.  We agreed to help him.~
@31585 = ~Abishai

We discovered that Aeij-Kllenzr't - Caged Fury - was a spirit of a tempest bound into Auril's altar.  He was the one forcing the white abishai to do his bidding, and banishing him lifted his control over them.~
@31638 = ~Message to Yquog

We came across a barghest whelp named Yquog.  He seemed distraught over a message he needed from his "masters," and that a dekanter goblin, named Kruntur, was withholding from him.  In exchange for some magical item in his possession, he asked us to find some peaceful way to get the message and bring it back to Yquog.  He also told us the password to get past his guards was *Xvim.*  Strange that such a normally evil being seems so interested in keeping another being alive - though he did mention his fear for his masters and what they would do to him if he attacked another one of his horde...  again.~
@31645 = ~Message to Yquog

It seems that the message Yquog was so anxious for us to retrieve was written in some obscure form of Abyssal.  It is unfortunate that none of us, or even Kruntur, can interpret the message.~
@31658 = ~Message to Yquog

We came across the barghest whelp, Yquog, that Kruntur told us about.  He said that he would give us the bracers on the condition that we return with a message that Kruntur is withholding.  Evidently this message is of some great worth, especially since it comes from the top commanders of the invading horde.~
@31661 = ~Message to Yquog

We returned with Yquog's message.  Unfortunately, we had no way of reading the message from the so-called "masters," since it was written in some sort of Abyssal language.  At least now we know we are dealing with someone, or something, that is familiar with the ways of the Abyss.~
@31666 = ~Message to Yquog

We returned with Yquog's message, but he went off the deep end when we told him that we killed Kruntur.  No matter, Yquog was a part of the invasion and needed to be destroyed.  It is too bad, however, that we could not find out more about his message.~
@31796 = ~Message to Yquog

We found Kruntur and proposed Yquog's bargain.  It turns out that Yquog ate Kruntur's brother and stole a pair of magical bracers off the dead body.  Kruntur asked us, none too nicely, to retrieve his brother's bracers and he will in turn give us Yquog's message.~
@31800 = ~Goblin Bracers

The bracers that we found on Yquog's body evidently belonged to Kruntur's dead brother.  We gave them back to Kruntur.~
@31801 = ~Goblin Bracers

We changed our mind after returning Krunbar's bracers to Kruntur, and forcefully took them back.~
@31802 = ~Goblin Bracers

We met a dekanter goblin, named Kruntur, who asked us to retrieve a pair of magical bracers.  Evidently there is a barghest whelp in the warrens we just left, named Yquog, who has these bracers.  We told Kruntur that we would find this Yquog and retrieve his bracers.~
@31809 = ~Message to Yquog

We were able to find a peaceful solution to Kruntur and Yquog's feud.  Everyone got what they requested and no blood was shed.  In the process, we were able to ascertain some kind of demonic connection between the so-called masters of this horde.~
@31887 = ~Remains from the Fell Wood

After we slew the will o'wisps, the hunter's ghost explained that we had given peace to the Restless Dead of Fell Wood.  Many spirits, silent but grateful, appeared to give us thanks, and left their mortal remains in our care.~
@31895 = ~Oria's Staff

During a battle with Aurilite High Priestess Oria we challenged her to break the staff she wielded, resulting in a bright flash followed by a wave of magical energy.  When the dust from the blast finally settled, her body was nowhere to be found.~
@31896 = ~Inner Sanctum

After what we thought to be her demise, we met High Priestess Oria once again and very much alive.  She claimed to exist within some sort of ethereal realm created by Nickademus called the Inner Sanctum, and it appears we'll be unable to affect her while we remain on the Prime Material Plane.~
@32061 = ~Aruma and Dolon

Aruma grew angry with our breaking into Dolon's chambers; we were forced to flee the monastery.~
@32062 = ~Aruma and Dolon

Aruma grew angry with our breaking into Dolon's chambers; we were forced to fight her and the rest of the monks.~
@32188 = ~Find Spider Aocha

Zack told us that he had a spider mount named Aocha with him when he was attacked by the remorhaz, but she was nowhere to be found.  We agreed to help him find her.~
@32189 = ~Find Spider Aocha

We found Zack's mount Aocha in a room that appears to be used to store the livestock fed to the remorhaz roaming the area.~
@32200 = ~Information for Zack

Apparently Zack is also investigating the ice temple, and we agreed to share whatever information we learned about it with him.  He was looking for as many details as possible, including who made it and for what purpose.~
@32201 = ~Information for Zack

We informed Zack of what we had learned about the ice temple.~
@32254 = ~Ilmater Sanctification Ritual

Riki informed us that Isair and Madae have allied with a deity named Iyachtu Xvim.  She said that severing their ties with him would severely weaken them.  We are to seek out a priest of Ilmater imprisoned in the War Tower and ask him about a purification ritual.~
@32255 = ~Cabal of Dragonkin

Riki warned us of a potential alliance between the Cabal of Dragonkin and Isair and Madae.  An envoy from the Cabal will be arriving at the Severed Hand soon.  We have decided to intercept this envoy and prevent this alliance.  The envoy will arrive at the aerie atop the War Tower.~
@32282 = ~Envoy from Dragon's Eye

One of the Ssethssars, the lesser priests of Sseth, told us that an envoy from Dragon's Eye, Jeszrael, was in the temple and seeking to get the aid of the yuan-ti to attack the humans in Kuldahar.~
@32287 = ~Ojaiha

Ojaiha tired of our questions and told us he had other matters to attend to.  He said we would speak later.~
@32290 = ~Close Portal to Chult

We tried to convince Ojaiha to seek some other solution rather than attacking Kuldahar, but he would not bend... his blood ties to Jeszrael and his dreams of empire flowed stronger than our words of peace, and he attacked us.  We tried our best, but I doubt anything could have swayed Ojaiha from his path.~
@32426 = ~The Guardian

We spoke with a Ssethssar, a lesser priest of Sseth, and he told us of the Guardian imprisoned atop the temple.  Apparently, the Guardian and the crossroads to Kuldahar are linked.  If the Guardian is slain, then the crossroads will collapse soon afterwards.~
@32430 = ~Envoy from Dragon's Eye

One of the Ssethssars, the lesser priests of Sseth, told us that an envoy from Dragon's Eye, Jeszrael, was in the temple and seeking to get the aid of the yuan-ti to attack the humans in Kuldahar.~
@32431 = ~Heartless dead

Apparently, the priests of Sseth have a ritual they perform on their human victims.  They cut out their hearts, then raise the bodies, turning the victims into heartless dead.  According to the priests, the heartless dead cannot achieve their final rest until they recover their hearts, so they seek them out if they are nearby.  The priest mentioned the heartless dead were difficult to control, so they had to place the hearts in the idol in the ritual chamber with many sealed doors between the idol and the pit so the dead could not get to them.~
@32525 = ~The Guardian

We spoke with a Ssethssar, a lesser priest of Sseth, and he told us of the Guardian imprisoned atop the temple.  Apparently, the Guardian and the crossroads to Kuldahar are linked.  If the Guardian is slain, then the crossroads will collapse soon afterwards.~
@32526 = ~Envoy from Dragon's Eye

One of the Ssethssars, the lesser priests of Sseth, told us that an envoy from Dragon's Eye, Jeszrael, was in the temple and seeking to get the aid of the yuan-ti to attack the humans in Kuldahar.~
@32527 = ~Heartless dead

Apparently, the priests of Sseth have a ritual they perform on their human victims.  They cut out their hearts, then raise the bodies, turning the victims into heartless dead.  According to the priests, the heartless dead cannot achieve their final rest until they recover their hearts, so they seek them out if they are nearby.  The priest mentioned the heartless dead were difficult to control, so they had to place the hearts in the idol in the ritual chamber with many sealed doors between the idol and the pit so the dead could not get to them.~
@32557 = ~Denham's Letters

Denham's trapped letter blew up in the so-called "Ingrath Mariner's" face.  Needless to say, the doppelganger was rather surprised.~
@32699 = ~Alliance with Iyachtu Xvim

Iyachtu Xvim interrupted our performing of the Ilmater Ritual.  Depending on the outcome of our conversation with Iyachtu Xvim, we may need to continue with the ritual.~
@32857 = ~Making Driders

Malavon has asked that we venture into the driders' caves to find and destroy whatever is allowing them to transform captured drow into even more driders.  He also requested that, should we see his sister Ginafae, we try to convince her to return to the drow encampment.  Seeing as she's currently the leader of the driders, it's more than likely we'll run across her.~
@32859 = ~Ginafae

We informed Malavon that we found Ginafae - his sister - but were forced to slay her.  He took solace in the fact that her death was likely a better fate than to have continued her tortured existence as a drider.~
@32866 = ~Ginafae

We returned to the drow encampment and spoke to both Malavon and Ginafae.  Both were grateful - Ginaefae in particular - and she rewarded us with valuable artifacts of the House Despana.~
@32905 = ~Illithid slaves

We tried to communicate with one of the mind flayers' thralls - slaves whose minds have been broken by the sinister psychic powers of the illithid - but to no avail.~
@32939 = ~Close Portal to Chult

In the jungle, we heard a yuan-ti priest named Sashkta reciting a list of challenges to white-robed initiates.  The questions were as follows: what approaches at dusk, what drowns Selune's gleaming on a cloudlesss night, who keeps the ancient venom of Sseth potent, and where does Sseth embrace unbelievers?  The answers were: the growing darkness, the obscuring moon of our faith, his faithful followers, and the cradle of scales, respectively.  After that point in their training, our presence was detected by the priest.~
@32960 = ~Treasury riddle

We spoke to an addle-minded yuan-ti chef in the temple, and he said he knew the last half of the six stone combination to the door to the north.  He said not to hit any stone twice, and that there were "...only three steps, for the other three your feet would be hard-pressed to step.  Hit not the same stone twice, and the sixth be the fourth, and the stone that follows the first be the last.  The fifth... count the number of fangs Ashra teaches, and the fifth number you shall have."  He then told us to seek out of the Viper's Fangs resting in the chamber west of Ashra, as when they are out of her sight, their tongues loosen, and they may tell us one of the first half of the puzzle.  Whatever's beyond the door better be worth it.~
@32967 = ~Troops in the Dragon's Eye

In a yuan-ti temple, an envoy from Dragon's Eye named Jeszrael told us that forces in Dragon's Eye itself contain pureblood and lizard men warriors, halfbreed sorceresses and priestesses, and abomination priests, much like the ones found in Chult.~
@33414 = ~Dark Treants

We found and slew the last of the Dark Treants in the Fell Wood, bringing to an end their warping influence upon the forest: the paths no longer twist and hide themselves, and their foul roots no longer grasp at unwary passersby.~
@33454 = ~Will o'wisps

We encountered one of the "ghost-lights" of Fell Wood.  It almost seems as if the things are attempting to lead us to our deaths at the hands of natural snares and pitfalls.~
@33679 = ~Antimagic Shell

The ice temple prison housing Nathaniel was shrouded by antimagic, preventing us from casting any spells.  When asked about it, Nathaniel told us he heard his captors say, "turn east then west to disable," but he didn't know what that meant.~
@33680 = ~Sacrificial dais

Three locked doors secured Xhaan's lair.  When asked about them, he said the doors only open when High Priestess Lysara performs her ritual.  He also said their locking mechanisms and perhaps other tricks are tied to the sacrificial dais she uses, but he did not know how.~
@33681 = ~Sacrificial dais

Xhaan told us the sacrificial dais Lysara uses during her ritual could be rotated left and right in one of eight directions, with its north position facing the center of his lair.~
@33728 = ~Will o'wisps

We came across a huge, gnarled tree deep within a forest, the lair of three will o'wisps.  We destroyed the lot of them, thereby ensuring that no more travelers would be lured to their deaths by the ghost-lights of Fell Wood.~
@33756 = ~Orrick the Grey

We spoke with Orrick the Grey and asked him if he is in league with the Legion of the Chimera.  He said that he is not, but that he does not openly oppose them either.  Apparently, he and the inhabitants of the Severed Hand are in a stalemate.  Neither side knows if they can defeat the other so they watch each other for signs of weakness.~
@33757 = ~Orrick the Grey

We asked Orrick if he would aid us in our battle against Isair and Madae.  He refused to oppose them openly, but he did give us some important information.  Apparently, there is a radiant pool here at the Severed Hand, somewhere on the third floor.  With this pool, Isair and Madae can heal and refresh their magical powers.  This could make them a formidable foe indeed.  We must find a way to taint this pool.  Orrick believes that the pool is somehow linked to Madae's deity, Iyachtu Xvim.  He has suggested that we seek out a priest to find a way to eliminate the pool.  We doubt that a priest of Xvim would aid us, so we seek one of another faith.~
@33758 = ~Orrick the Grey

We asked Orrick if he would aid us in our battle against Isair and Madae.  He refused to oppose them openly, but he did give us some important information.  Apparently, there is a radiant pool here at the Severed Hand, somewhere on the third floor.  With this pool, Isair and Madae can heal and refresh their magical powers.  This could make them a formidable foe indeed.  We must find a way to taint this pool.  Orrick believes that the pool is somehow linked to Madae's deity, Iyachtu Xvim.  He has suggested that we seek out a priest to find a way to eliminate the pool.  We told him of the purification ritual that the priest of Ilmater has asked us to perform.  He feels that it is worth a try.~
@33759 = ~Orrick the Grey

Orrick believes that the mythal protecting the Severed Hand has become corrupt.  He said that he must investigate the matter some more before he can tell us the nature of the corruption.~
@33760 = ~Orrick the Grey

Orrick has completed his investigation into the mythal corruption.  He has found that the mythal has activated and bound itself to the plane of limbo.  He speculates that it is going to shift the Severed Hand onto that plane.  He has warned us to be prepared to flee for our lives at a moment's notice.~
@33761 = ~Send Puddy Home

We spoke with Orrick about the gnome, Puddy Talltale.  Orrick has agreed to send him home if he can make his way to the tower.~
@34051 = ~Orrick's apprentices

We spoke with a goblin apprentice in the Mage's Tower.  He told us that Orrick the Grey is on the third floor of the tower.~
@34097 = ~Orrick's apprentices

We spoke with a goblin apprentice in the Mage's Tower.  He told us that Orrick the Grey is on the third floor of the tower.  Or so he believes.~
@34129 = ~Orrick's apprentices

We spoke with Weenagoo, Orrick the Grey's apprentice.  He told us that Orrick can be found on the third floor of the Mage's Tower.~
@34178 = ~Orrick's apprentices

We met a gnoll in the Mage's Tower.  He could understand us, but could not speak.  Surprisingly we had little trouble in communicating.   We asked where Orrick the Grey could be found.  He indicated that he is on the third floor of the tower.~
@34202 = ~Orrick the Grey

We spoke with the librarian in the Mage's Tower.  He told us we can find Orrick the Grey on the third floor of the tower.~
@34231 = ~Magical Barrier

We disabled a magical barrier covering the archway to a place called Andora.  It appears safe to pass through now.~
@34400 = ~Kill Black Raven Monks

Barud Barzam tried to reward us for clearing the river caves with wealth and magical items, but we refused.  He then made another offer - if we kill all the monks of the Black Raven Monastery, he will reward us even further.  Barud claims that the duergar lost both the outpost and the Underdark passage to the monks long ago; with the outpost secured, he now wants our help in recovering the passage beneath the monastery.~
@34402 = ~Kill Black Raven Monks

Barud Barzam tried to reward us for killing all the monks of Black Raven Monastery with wealth and magical items, but we refused.~
@34747 = ~Lost children

Just as the paladin sensed Limha's true nature, a child suddenly burst out of a holding pen hidden in Limha's home and begged us to save him - a happy coincidence for all involved save Limha, no doubt.~
@34762 = ~Boring Beetles

We didn't realize the full extent of the damage to Oswald's airship until we went outside to the foothills.  As the boring beetles continued their attack, we heard a distant call for help from someone in excruciating pain.  We should investigate that plea for help once we've dealt with the beetles.~
@34857 = ~Oria's Staff

Nickademus told us that High Priestess Oria tried killing us with the Retributive Strike from her Staff of Power, but she ended up in the ethereal realm instead.  His Inner Sanctum is complete, and we can use it to reach her, but she's lost forever because she traveled to that realm directly.  He told us to go to the Game Room southeast of his bedroom, turn on switch 'Mode Selector 1,' turn off switch 'Mode Selector 2,' then turn on switch 'Mode Activator.'  We'll be able to defeat her while in the Inner Sanctum, but we must turn the mode off when we're done or be trapped in there forever.~
@34931 = ~Ubchug Babblemug

We found an annoying little know-it-all who went by the name Ubchug Babblemug.  It was all we could stand to converse with him, but when we discovered that he did not know the whereabouts of Isair and Madae, it seemed to scare Ubchug.  It seems that he cannot live with the fact that there is something in this world that he does not know and, even worse, he cannot stand the possibility that someone else might find out.  So, in exchange for our silence, he gave us this thing he called *it.*  Quite frankly, we have no idea what *it* is - and neither did he, for that matter - but strangely, with *it* in our inventory, we *feel* that now we have everything - we really do not - it just feels like it.  Very strange, indeed.~
@34983 = ~Gate to the Prison

We opened the gate to the prison by using the rack in the nearby torture chamber.~
@34990 = ~Mandal Graye

At the end of a hallway on the second level of Dragon's Eye we found the remains of Mandal Graye, Nheero Fhutma's traveling companion.~
@34992 = ~Mandrake root

Mandal's soul led us to the room where he threw Nheero's modified mandrake root before he died, and we found it there.~
@35029 = ~Commander Grishum

We encountered a man named Commander Grishum leading a combined force of yuan-ti and lizardmen.  He told us our progress through Dragon's Eye would be futile because his people have had years to prepare their defenses.~
@35030 = ~Commander Grishum

Yuan-ti pureblood Commander Grishum told us that his people would openly defy us, unlike his elders who were convinced by someone named Yxunomei to rely on guile to achieve their goals.~
@35047 = ~Get Nheero out of jail

Nheero said the prison gate could not be forced open and was rigged with an alarm that would summon more guards.  He suggested we disable the alarm before opening the door.~
@35049 = ~Nheero Fhutma

Nheero Fhutma told us that he has spent most of his adult life studying the yuan-ti.~
@35050 = ~Histachii Transformation

Nheero told us that he and his traveling companion, Mandal Graye, entered the base of Dragon's Eye from the Fields of Slaughter.  Once they reached the next level he let himself be captured by a group of yuan-ti abominations while Mandal snuck away to continue his mission.~
@35051 = ~Histachii Transformation

Nheero let himself be captured by the yuan-ti so he could experience their Histachii Transformation.~
@35052 = ~Histachii Transformation

Mandal Graye, Nheero's traveling companion, was supposed to find where the yuan-ti make their histachii brew and replace the mandrake root used in the process with a version Nheero had modified.  The resulting brew would be less potent, thus allowing him to keep his wits about him as he temporarily experienced the full sensation of the transformation.~
@35053 = ~Mandrake root

Mandal did not contact Nheero to let him know if his mission to swap the mandrake root was successful, so we agreed to find him.~
@35056 = ~Histachii Transformation

With Mandal having failed his mission, Nheero risked becoming a yuan-ti histachii permantly.  We agreed to complete Mandal's mission to prevent this undesirable fate.  The first thing we had to do was find the mandrake root that was modified by Nheero and given to Mandal.~
@35059 = ~Histachii Transformation

Having found the modified mandrake root we are now able to complete Mandal's mission.  To do this we must find the yuan-ti's lab on the level below, and either secretly replace their mandrake root with Nheero's version before the preparation process, convince the alchemist, D'hey-jazerrion to create the mixture, or, if we have enough skill in alchemy, we could create the mixture ourselves if we could find D'hey-jazerrion's alchemy notes.  Nheero told us to bring him the brew after it has been sabotaged, but that we *must* replace the modified mandrake root with the original mandrake root to maintain the deception.  Once the sabotaged brew has been made and the mandrake root switched back to the original, then we will have completed Mandal's mission.~
@35060 = ~Histachii Transformation

We have found the room where the yuan-ti make their histachii brew.  Now we need to replace the mandrake root they use in the process with Nheero's modified version.~
@35061 = ~Histachii Transformation

We have replaced the mandrake root used in the process of making the yuan-ti histachii brew with Nheero's modified version.  Now we need to wait until the weaker version of the brew is made.~
@35062 = ~Histachii Transformation

The weaker version of the histachii brew has just been created.  Now we need to replace the modified root with the original one to maintain the deception.~
@35063 = ~Histachii Transformation

We have successfully completed Mandal's mission, resulting in the creation of a weaker version of the yuan-ti's histachii brew.  Nheero was pleased with our success and told us to seek him out in the northwest egg chamber on the level below when we wished to speak with him again.  ~
@35064 = ~The prison

The prison holding Nheero is divided into three sections.  Unintelligent human males are kept in the southern section and turned into histachii, intelligent human males are kept in the northern section and forced to mate with female yuan-ti halfbreeds, and the eastern section is reserved for the others to be used for food, torture, or experimentation.~
@35065 = ~Passage in the statue

Nheero told us that when he was captured by the yuan-ti after entering the base of Dragon's Eye from the Fields of Slaughter he remembered being dragged along a ramp inside the statue of Sseth.  The statue is located in the barracks in the north section on the first level.  He also remembered passing a yuan-ti priestess carrying a bag of fire agates.~
@35067 = ~Legion of the Chimera's emblem

According to Nheero, neo-orogs and other beasts bearing the Legion of the Chimera's emblem have been emerging from the lower levels and exiting Dragon's Eye with no opposition from either the yuan-ti or lizardmen.~
@35068 = ~Mandal Graye

When asked about what might have happened to Mandal's body, Nheero told us that he was probably slain without his sword, The Sword of Myrloch Vale.  Mandal is an aasimar - a human with celestial blood - who has had a bond with his sword ever since he died and was then cursed while obtaining it in Haunted Hills of Eveningstar.  As a result, if he should die without his blade he'll be forever doomed as a wandering spirit until the sword is found and returned to him.   If we did this and brought Mandal's soul peace, then perhaps he'd lead us to the location of the modified mandrake root.~
@35069 = ~Feyrs

According to Nheero, strange creatures with purple skin, several eyes and tentacles that attacked us at night are called feyrs.  They are created from the remnants of nightmares, mixed with residual magical energies, and brought to life by the strong emotions of a large group of people.~
@35070 = ~Feyrs

Through research Nheero discovered that a large force of yuan-ti are living in Dragon's Eye - many of them practitioners of the arcane arts.  Threats from forces rising against the Legion of the Chimera and rumors of an impending doom - possibly another eruption - have been giving many of them nightmares.  This is why feyrs have been created.~
@35072 = ~Nheero's research

We asked Nheero a question, but he needed time and access to a library's research materials before he could answer it.~
@35073 = ~Nheero's research

In the yuan-ti library we asked Nheero another question, but he said that the materials there were insufficient and asked us if we'd seen any other research facility, such as a study.~
@35075 = ~Yuan-ti

Nheero told us that only yuan-ti can see High Priest Thorasskus, also known as "One-Of-Many," and only after they've been cleansed through prayer and meditation under Sseth's watchful eye.~
@35076 = ~Yuan-ti

Nheero told us that the yuan-ti are evil but intelligent snake people who worship Sseth, the Great Snake and Intermediate Power of the Abyss.  They adhere to a hierarchical order and are comprised of almost-human purebloods, female halfbreeds, ruling abominations, and a high priest.  They fight brilliantly, relying on their surroundings and elaborate traps often coated with poison.  When not stalking prey, their priests divide their time between prayer, bloody sacrifices, summonings, and other rituals.~
@35081 = ~Chumbra

Once Nheero completed his Histachii Transformation he knew that Chumbra was blind, relying only on sounds, smells, movement and vibrations to find its prey.~
@35082 = ~Chumbra

After spending time in the library doing research, Nheero learned that if Chumbra was encountered it could be avoided by staying completely still and silent until it ignored you.~
@35083 = ~Chumbra

Nheero completed his understanding of Chumbra after spending time in the study.  Ironically, Chumbra will be temporarily incapacitated if poisoned enough, and can only be killed by an intense blast of fire.~
@35084 = ~Breeding wyverns

Nheero told us that many wyverns infest the caves of Dragon's Eye, and that they were frequently "farmed" for their venom.  He said it was possible to manufacture wyvern poison provided we had access to an alchemical lab and some part of a wyvern to complete the venom.  All we needed to do was place a part of the wyvern on a lab bench, then set to work.  He said the yuan-ti have a lab somewhere in Dragon's Eye where we could create the venom.~
@35227 = ~Efreet Assassins

Within a secluded room protected by a mechanical bridge on the third level of Dragon's Eye we ran into a boy being attacked by efreet.~
@35228 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

The boy we rescued from the efreet couldn't find his mother, but he said her name was Izbelah.~
@35229 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

The "boy" turned out to be yuan-ti High Priest Thorasskus.  He used a disguise to trick us into helping him fend off the efreet and finding High Sorceress Izbelah, who attacked us at the entrance to Dragon's Eye but is now missing.  He claimed the efreet were sent by a Lord Pyros, despite the fact that a deal had been made between the yuan-ti, Lord Pyros, and the Legion of the Chimera.  According to him, half-dragon Sherincal met with Cedra and High Sorceress Izbelah, and they reached an agreement.  The yuan-ti were to use the defenses they'd erected against intruders from Kuldahar while giving the Legion of the Chimera free passage.  In exchange, the Legion would eliminate Kuldahar's aristocracy, leaving its citizens, warmth, and stability at the yuan-ti's mercy.~
@35314 = ~Nathaniel in Dragon's Eye

We met Nathaniel traveling through Dragon's Eye's second level.  Iselore apparently sent him ahead of us in Oswald's airship to offer assistance in any way possible.~
@35315 = ~Nathaniel in Dragon's Eye

Nathaniel told us that if we, or any allies we encounter, need assistance we should return to him and he'll protect us in his "haven" that we can only describe as a small, tropical paradise.~
@35316 = ~Nathaniel in Dragon's Eye

As things often conclude being too good to be true, such was the case with "Nathaniel."  Once finished with his deception, he dispelled his illusions and attacked us.  In actuality, he was a Rakshasa Maharajah, reading our minds to create a tranquil environment and pose as the real Nathaniel so that we'd let our guard down.  Naturally we had other plans in mind.~
@35518 = ~Imphraili's Laboratory

We were able to use some of the reagents in the alchemical laboratory in the drider caves to increase the potency of a healing potion.~
@35616 = ~Band of Assassins

We encountered a drow priestess of Lolth and her entourage of spellswords and assassins hiding just outside the Rilauvenian camp.  It seems they'd come to rid the Underdark of Malavon and his companions.~
@35617 = ~Band of Assassins

We encountered the assassins that Viizra spoke of - a drow priestess of Lolth and her entourage, all hiding just outside the Rilauvenian camp.  It seems they'd finally come to rid the Underdark of Malavon and his companions.~
@35654 = ~Dereth Springsong

We rescued Dereth Springsong, the Druid of Shaengarne, from a band of orcs on the river, and he has agreed to open the way to Shaengarne Ford for us if we will clear his home of orcs.  Fortunately, we had done so already.~
@35655 = ~Dereth Springsong

We have removed the orcs from Dereth's home.  He has opened the path to the Ford as he said he would.~
@35656 = ~Sabrina Fairwynd

Dereth Springsong has asked us to keep an eye open for his wife, Sabrina Fairwynd.  Apparently she has been missing since the orcs arrived at the river.~
@35657 = ~Sabrina and Dereth

We met with Dereth again.  He gave us an enchanted weapon as a reward.~
@35730 = ~Imphraili's Laboratory

We used the last of reagents necessary to increase the potency of healing potions in the drider cave laboratory.~
@35731 = ~Imphraili's Laboratory

We used Imphraili's notes to complete her theoretical experiment regarding the transfusion of a modified Sanguis Anima into one's own bloodstream.  The process was difficult and painful but left our transmuter strangely invigorated.~
@35735 = ~Modified Golem

We used Imphraili's notes to concoct the Sanguis Anima.  Once the life-giving solution is injected into the inanimate flesh golem, jolting the monster with electricity should awaken it to serve us.~
@35736 = ~Making Driders

We used Imphraili's notes to concoct a conversion poison for the Viciscamera.  The poison should turn the living machine's formidable defenses against itself, causing it to rot and die within seconds.~
@35756 = ~Trail of blood

Once reaching the third level of Dragon's Eye we noticed a recently dried trail of blood traveling towards the entrance from the south.~
@35758 = ~Mandal Graye

South of the entrance to Dragon's Eye's third level was a circular room protected by sharp, retractable fangs.  The room showed signs of a recent battle, and on its floor laid a sword with the word "Mandal" stitched into its scabbard.~
@35806 = ~Assassination of Lord Piros

An undead boatman named Archon told us that Inquisitor Venomin killed Lord Pyros the day before we arrived at the bottom of Dragon's Eye.~
@35828 = ~Inquisitor Venomin

We met a yuan-ti inquisitor on the last level of Dragon's Eye named Venomin.  He claimed to have caused a war between the yuan-ti and the "Lords of Fire", wishing he could "return to yesterday" to undo the damage he'd caused.  Before we could question him further he leapt to his death into the sea of magma.~
@35829 = ~Time Loop

It seems that when yuan-ti Inquisitor Venomin wished he could "return to yesterday" that was more wishful thinking than an actual granted wish.  We doubt he's the cause of the time loop.~
@35830 = ~Inquisitor Venomin

We met Inquisitor Venomin again in the same location as yesterday and he said the exact same thing to us, but we were still unable to get any more information from him before he wished for "yesterday" then committed suicide.~
@35846 = ~Assassination of Lord Piros

Amidst a ruined palace on Dragon's Eye's last level - its magma chamber - we met a fire salamander named Ambassador Jasper who was a liaison between the residents here and the yuan-ti.  He told us High Priest Thorasskus sent yuan-ti pureblood inquisitor Venomin here three days ago to conduct an investigation into the disappearance of High Sorceress Izbelah.  For reasons he was unaware of, Venomin killed Lord Pyros yesterday and fled to Jasper's embassy east of the palace.  As a result, King Lothar assumed control, declared war on the yuan-ti, destroyed the embassy, and sent efreet assassins after Thorasskus.  When the yuan-ti responded, chaos erupted.  Izbelah was instantly killed two days ago while, from what he understood, escaping from Lothar's cage.~
@35847 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

Jasper didn't know why Izbelah was caged because he was away on business, and she was already imprisoned when he returned.  Though he suspected foul play, he awaited the results of Venomin's investigation.~
@35848 = ~Zil-t'yor

Jasper said someone named Zil-t'yor was the current leader who took control during the war and united the survivors.~
@35849 = ~Fields of Slaughter

Jasper said Zil-t'yor often travels to and from the Fields of Slaughter.  He believes that's where he's from.~
@35850 = ~Time Loop

Stepping through what we thought was the exit from Dragon's Eye to the Fields of Slaughter we were surprised to find our surroundings quite familiar, though rather different.  Buildings that once were demolished are now in perfect condition and no signs of a war are visible.  In fact, it looks like we never left Dragon's Eye's magma chamber at all.  Another observation of note is the fact that the air feels much cooler, and it appears the magma sea has receded somewhat.  When we encountered Ambassador Jasper again he acted as if he'd never met us.~
@35851 = ~Meeting of Piros and Venomin

According to Jasper, not only was there no war, but also Lord Pyros and Inquisitor Venomin are both still alive and about to conclude their private meeting at the palace.~
@35852 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

When asked about High Sorceress Izbelah, Jasper told us she died "last night" while trying to escape from King Lothar's cage.  Since the last time we spoke to him about her he said she died "two days" ago, we conclude that he was either lying or mistaken, or that we're victims of some type of phenomenon.  From what we've observed so far, the latter seems to be the case.~
@35853 = ~Zil-t'yor

Jasper told us that they drove beholder Zil-t'yor away two days ago.  He must have healed his wounds and returned with a vengeance when we fought him.~
@35871 = ~Zil-t'yor

Jasper told us that they drove beholder Zil-t'yor away a day ago.  He must have healed his wounds and returned with a vengeance when we fought him.~
@35891 = ~Sabrina and Dereth

We rescued Sabrina Fairwynd from an orc band.  She was grateful for our aid.~
@35892 = ~Deadly trap

Sabrina warned us of a deadly trap that has been set by the orcs.  To circumvent it, we must find and slay an orc lookout that watches for intruders along the river.  The lookout can be found along a trail to the north and east of the main orc camp.~
@35941 = ~Orc hostages

We met a woman named Kaitlin in the ruins of a logging village.  She said that Torak sent her to us with an ultimatum.  We are not to approach his camp, or he will slay the villagers that he holds as hostage.~
@35942 = ~Orc hostages

Kaitlin asked us to free her people from the orcs.  She said that they are being held captive at a nearby mill.  To free them we would need to unlock the gate to the mill and then slay the orc guards.  Unfortunately, the gate can only be unlocked from within the orc camp.  We would have to sneak in, unlock the gate, and then sneak back out.  A daunting task, but we accepted.~
@35943 = ~Orc hostages

Kaitlin asked us to free her people from the orcs.  She said that they are being held captive at a nearby mill.  To free them we would need to unlock the gate to the mill and then slay the orc guards.  Unfortunately, the gate can only be unlocked from within the orc camp.  We would have to sneak in, unlock the gate, and then sneak back out.   We refused and chased her off.~
@35944 = ~Orc hostages

Kaitlin asked us to free her people from the orcs.  She said that they are being held captive at a nearby mill.  To free them we would need to unlock the gate to the mill and then slay the orc guards.  Unfortunately, the gate can only be unlocked from within the orc camp.  We would have to sneak in, unlock the gate, and then sneak back out.  We refused and then attacked her.~
@35945 = ~Dam on the river

We asked Kaitlin what the orcs wanted with her village in the first place.  She said that they needed lumber to build a fortress in the plains to the north and a dam somewhere along the river.  It is possible that the damn could be used to flood the lands upriver and around Maer Dualdon, possibly destroying Targos.~
@35946 = ~Orc hostages

We met with Kaitlin and told her that we rescued her people.~
@35947 = ~Orc hostages

We met with Kaitlin and told her that her people were dead.~
@35948 = ~Clear Shaengarne Bridge

We asked Kaitlin if she knew the path to Shaengarne Ford.  She said it lies beyond the highland pass, north of the mill.~
@35949 = ~Dam on the river

We remembered speaking with Kaitlin about a dam being constructed somewhere upriver.  She believes it to be beyond the highland pass on the way to Shaengarne Ford.~
@36025 = ~Efreet Assassins

Lord Pyros told us he did not send efreet assassins after High Priest Thorasskus.~
@36037 = ~Lord Pyros

Roughly thirty years ago Kossuth, God of Fire, molded Lord Pyros from pure magma, giving him life, powers, will, and intelligence.  Unfortunately the magma chamber, within a violent eruption, was created in the process.  Pyros then summoned allies, including the great King Lothar, by his side to maintain his domain.  Ambassador Jasper voluntarily became the liaison between his magma city and the yuan-ti living above.~
@36055 = ~Time Loop

King Lothar told us that High Priestess Izbelah succeeded in casting a Temporal Stasis spell before being captured, but it's been breaking down ever since.  He also said that the only thing the spell succeeded in doing was keeping people like Zil-t'yor and us away from this magma chamber.  Discussing it amongst ourselves, we're convinced that her flawed spell created the loop we're now in, and we can break it if we prevent her from completing her spell at Jasper's embassy four days ago.~
@36056 = ~Time Loop

King Lothar told us that High Priestess Izbelah succeeded in casting a Temporal Stasis spell before being captured, but it's been breaking down ever since.  He also said that the only thing the spell succeeded in doing was keeping people like Zil-t'yor and us away from this magma chamber.  Discussing it amongst ourselves, we're convinced that her flawed spell created the loop we're now in, and we can break it if we prevent her from completing her spell at Jasper's embassy three days ago.~
@36057 = ~Time Loop

King Lothar told us that High Priestess Izbelah succeeded in casting a Temporal Stasis spell before being captured, but it's been breaking down ever since.  He also said that the only thing the spell succeeded in doing was keeping people like Zil-t'yor and us away from this magma chamber.  Discussing it amongst ourselves, we're convinced that her flawed spell created the loop we're now in, and we can break it if we prevent her from completing her spell at Jasper's embassy two days ago.~
@36058 = ~Time Loop

King Lothar told us that High Priestess Izbelah succeeded in casting a Temporal Stasis spell before being captured, but it's been breaking down ever since.  He also said that the only thing the spell succeeded in doing was keeping people like Zil-t'yor and us away from this magma chamber.  Discussing it amongst ourselves, we're convinced that her flawed spell created the loop we're now in, and we can break it if we prevent her from completing her spell at Jasper's embassy yesterday.~
@36076 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

Lord Pyros said High Sorceress Izbelah broke one of his laws by attempting to curb the boil of magma and the flow of lava with twisted magic.  For that she must be judged and her confinement is Lothar's task.  We are to consult Lothar either while he is on duty or at his citadel if we wish to ask about her.~
@36077 = ~Zil-t'yor

Three days "prior" to our arrival, Lord Pyros had no idea who Zil-t'yor was.  Perhaps the beholder will stay dead, unlike the others on this level.~
@36102 = ~Zil-t'yor

A beholder named Zil-t'yor was preventing us from exiting the last level of Dragon's Eye onto the Fields of Slaughter.  However he apparently wasn't a member of the Legion of the Chimera.~
@36103 = ~Zil-t'yor

Zil-t'yor said that since we entered Dragon's Eye's bottom level - its magma chamber - from the upper levels, "everything would change" if we went through the exit leading to the Fields of Slaughter.~
@36104 = ~Zil-t'yor

Zil-t'yor refused to explain what he meant, but said that if we did take the exit he'd have to do his work over again.~
@36105 = ~Zil-t'yor

When pressed further, Zil-t'yor said that when he came here three days ago from the Fields of Slaughter he had trouble reaching Dragon's Eye's upper levels.  He witnessed an investigation, a trial, and an "accidental death", but yesterday Venomin killed Lord Pyros and a war between the yuan-ti and elementals emerged.  In the end he killed a weak King Lothar and united the survivors under his command.~
@36175 = ~Severed Hand

We diplomatically worked our way past the Guard Commander in front of the Severed Hand entrance.  In addition, she mentioned that we should see the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xavier Torsend, as soon as we enter, to acquire a delegate pass.  However, we did not let her live long enough to discover her mistake.~
@36176 = ~Severed Hand

We were unsuccessful in our attempt to bluff our way past the Guard Commander in front of the Severed Hand entrance.  However, she did let slip that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xavier Torsend, has the power to hand out delegate passes.  Perhaps he would be a good person to see first, once we get inside.~
@36177 = ~Severed Hand

We confronted the Guard Commander of the Severed Hand and discovered there was a Minister of Foreign Affairs within the walls.  Perhaps we should seek this person out first.~
@36210 = ~Chieftain Torak

We met Torak, the chieftain of the Broken Tusk orc clan.  He and his followers are in control of the Shaengarne river.  ~
@36211 = ~Chieftain Torak

Torak managed to escape us once again.  He has fled across the river to the northeast.  He seemed desperate this time.  He must be running out of places to flee to.~
@36263 = ~Vrek Vileclaw

We met a troll, Vrek Vileclaw, who seemed very smart for his kind.  It intended to keep the Shaengarne villagers as breeding stock so that it would not need to hunt for food again.~
@36311 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

One of the Flamewalker residents of Dragon's Eye's magma chamber told us a trial was held for Izbelah yesterday at the amphitheatre.  She was accused of violating Nature's Order, but Inquisitor Venomin offered her a good defense.~
@36312 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

During the trial, the issue of Izbelah's guilt was discussed and the evidence presented, but they adjourned because Venomin needed to ask a few questions of Ambassador Jasper, who was away on business.  Supposedly, Venomin has proven Izbelah's innocence today.~
@36400 = ~Emma Moonblade

We met a priestess named Emma Moonblade.  It seems that her sword, a Moonblade of Selune, was stolen by a troll.  She has asked us to recover it for her.~
@36401 = ~Emma Moonblade

We met a priestess named Emma Moonblade.  It seems that her sword, a Moonblade of Selune, was stolen by a troll.  She has asked us to recover it for her.  We agreed to do so for a price.  She will offer us healing for a mere gold.~
@36402 = ~Emma Moonblade

We threatened Emma Moonblade.  She managed to escape us, but vowed to return and even the score with us.~
@36403 = ~Emma Moonblade

Emma Moonblade became enraged with us for chasing Kaitlin away.  She then left, but vowed to return and even the score with us.~
@36404 = ~Emma Moonblade

Emma Moonblade became enraged with us for slaying Kaitlin.  She then left, but vowed to return and even the score with us.~
@36405 = ~Emma Moonblade

We recovered the sword of Emma Moonblade.  She was most grateful.~
@36406 = ~Emma Moonblade

We recovered the sword of Emma Moonblade.  However, she requested that we keep the blade as a gift.  She was impressed with our deeds since we have come to the Shaengarne.~
@36490 = ~Parley

We spoke to a mage named Xuki at the caravan bridge.  She wanted to parley, but we would have nothing of it.~
@36491 = ~Xuki's ruse

We parlayed with a mage named Xuki at the caravan bridge.  She spoke of a peaceful solution to the war between the Legion of the Chimera and the Ten-Towns, and then asked that we set up a meeting with Lord Ulbrec to facilitate peace talks.  Unfortunately, it was a ruse.  By delaying our assault on the forces at the bridge, it was destroyed.~
@36494 = ~Xuki's ruse

We parlayed with a mage named Xuki at the caravan bridge.  She spoke of a peaceful solution to the war between the Legion of the Chimera and the Ten-Towns, and then asked that we set up a meeting with Lord Ulbrec to facilitate peace talks.  Unfortunately, it was a ruse, an attempt to delay us from engaging the forces at the bridge.  We did not fall for it.~
@36559 = ~Meeting of Piros and Venomin

When asked to see the palace, Archon told us Lord Pyros was having a private meeting with Inquisitor Venomin and could not be disturbed.  We're not quite sure how that's possible, since according to both Ambassador *and* Archon, Lord Pyros was killed by Venomin yesterday.  We also witnessed Venomin's suicide with our own eyes.~
@36569 = ~Lone chest

We saw a lone chest on a small island in Dragon's Eye's magma sea, but no obvious way to get to it.~
@36570 = ~Lone chest

It appears lava mephits have built a lair on the island containing the chest we saw.~
@36734 = ~Time Loop

Well, that confirms it.  This level is definitely caught in a time loop, as this is our second iteration.  Just how far back in time the loop goes we're not sure about yet, but we do know it recedes one day whenever we take the exit to the Fields of Slaughter.  We'll need to escape this loop if we are to continue our mission.  Some observations we've made are that the air feels even cooler, the magma sea continues to recede, and the torches have become brighter.  Also, if our notes are correct, Lord Pyros should be alive today.~
@36828 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

One of the Flamewalker residents of Dragon's Eye's magma chamber told us a trial was held for Izbelah two days ago at the amphitheatre.  She was accused of violating Nature's Order, but Inquisitor Venomin proved her innocence.~
@36829 = ~High Sorceress Izbelah

During the trial, the issue of Izbelah's guilt was discussed and the evidence presented, but they adjourned because Venomin needed to ask a few questions of Ambassador Jasper, who was away on business.  Supposedly, Venomin proved her innocence yesterday, but she still tried to escape last night.~
@36979 = ~Cedrin Zil

We met a man named Cedrin Zil.  He is the curator for a library on the second floor of the Severed Hand.~
@36980 = ~Diary of Zaem Astyr

We found a diary hidden among the library shelves.  It was burned almost beyond recognition, but one entry did survive the damage.  In it, a man named Zaem Astyr writes of a creature that has turned against him and begun to stalk him.  We get the impression that Zaem feared for his life.~
@36981 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with the librarian, Cedrin Zil, about Zaem Astyr.  It seems that he was found dead a few days ago from an apparent suicide.  After examining the diary we found, Cedrin felt that the creature mentioned in it may have murdered Zaem and then made his death appear a suicide to cover its tracks.  Having spoken with the creature, we do not believe it committed the crime.~
@36982 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with the librarian, Cedrin Zil, about Zaem Astyr.  It seems that he was found dead a few days ago from an apparent suicide.  After examining the diary we found, Cedrin felt that the creature mentioned in it may have murdered Zaem and then made his death appear a suicide to cover its tracks.  Having spoken with the creature, we do not believe it committed the crime.~
@36983 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with Cedrin for quite some time about the death of Zaem Astyr.  There are things about his death that just do not add up.  Apparently a priest tried to raise Zaem from the dead, but the attempt failed.  This is no surprise if Zaem did indeed commit suicide.  His spirit would not want to return, so the spell would fail.  However, when the priest attempted to speak with the dead that spell failed as well.  This would indicate that Zaem's spirit has been destroyed.  If his death was a suicide, this would not be the case.  It almost seems like someone wanted Zaem permanently dead and unable to be communicated with as well.  If that is the case, then his death is not a suicide.  It is a murder and the guilty party has prevented Zaem's spirit from being able to testify against him or her.~
@36984 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

According to Cedrin Zil, not everyone is satisfied that Zaem Astyr's death was a suicide.  It seems that his apprentice, Kav Lathram, and his betrothed, Jaebrilla, harbor doubts.  Perhaps we should speak with them.  Kav Lathram can be found in his master's old laboratory.  It is located near the library on the second floor of the Hand.  Jaebrilla is a serving wench.  She can be found in the servant's quarters on the fourth floor.~
@36985 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We have debated this Zaem Astyr matter amongst ourselves.  It is an intriguing case to say the least.  Perhaps we will look into it.~
@36986 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We have debated this Zaem Astyr matter amongst ourselves.  Although we could care less about a dead mage, it is an intriguing case to say the least.  Perhaps we will look into it.~
@36988 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We confronted Cedrin Zil and accused him of murdering Zaem Astyr.  He denied everything.  However, we convinced him to play out a hypothetical situation and detail why and how the deed could have been accomplished.  Cedrin wove a tale of jealousy and hatred for an ambitious young mage who replaced him in the enclave.  He continued to speak about a man who met a young lady, fell in love, and began to change from a cold ruthless person, into one more gentle and caring.  A man whom she could respect, but Cedrin could not.  He then spoke of how a mage could assume this woman's image, get inside her lover's defenses and strike down the man who trusted her above all others...  A sick and devious plan.~

A devious plan, well orchestrated and played out.~
@36990 = ~Cedrin Zil

We considered slaying Cedrin Zil for his crime, but he is under the protection of the Thayvian enclave.  Were we to strike, they would all descend on us.  Perhaps we can find another way for justice to prevail in this matter, perhaps not.  Time will tell.~
@36991 = ~Cedrin Zil

We considered slaying Cedrin Zil for his crime, but he is under the protection of the Thayvian enclave.  Were we to strike, they would all descend on us...  Still, it is worth a try, especially if it means taking the murderer down.~
@37141 = ~Food for the Slaves

We found the food thief today.  It turned out to be the strangest creature.  It was incredibly fast and out of focus to the eye.  In any case, we convinced it to stop stealing the food from the slaves.  This was not hard to do, actually.  The creature seemed genuinely remorseful for its actions.~
@37142 = ~Creation of Zaem Astyr

We identified the food thief as the creation of Zaem Astyr.  We spoke with him briefly about Zaem's death.  During the conversation we concluded that he is not responsible for Zaem's death.~
@37143 = ~Food for the Slaves

We agreed to help the food thief find a new source of food.  We will begin our search soon.~
@37144 = ~Food for the Slaves

We found a ring of nourishment for the food thief.  So long as he wears it, he will never be hungry again.  He was most grateful.~
@37298 = ~Creation of Zaem Astyr

We told the creature, Zaem, that his creator's murderer has been brought to justice.~
@37300 = ~Apprentice of Zaem Astyr

We met Kav Lathram, the apprentice of Zaem Astyr today.  He seemed genuinely disturbed over his death.~
@37301 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We asked Kav if he thought Zaem's death was a suicide.  He said no and we asked him to explain why.  It seems that Zaem's research notes were found destroyed.  Kav has some skill at restoring documents so he managed to recover them.  Upon examining them he believes them to be forgeries.  If that is the case, then Zaem's real notes are missing.  Could Zaem have been murdered for his research?~
@37302 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We think we have discovered who murdered Zaem Astyr.  We have spoken with both Kav Lathram, his apprentice, and Jaebrilla, his betrothed, and neither knew what his research involved.  It seems that Zaem did indeed consider his work confidential, and would not even speak of it with the two people who meant the most to him in life.  However, we remember Cedrin Zil, the librarian telling us exactly what Zaem was working on.  We also recall Kav Lathram telling us that Zaem's research notes were not destroyed, but missing.  We believe that Cedrin murdered Zaem and read his notes.  We need to confront him with this.~
@37303 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with Kav again to let him know that the murderer of his master is dead.  Justice has been served in this matter.~
@37304 = ~Fake drawings

Kav Lathram has some skill in restoring documents so we asked if he could alter the Severed Hand plans for Ysha.  He was able to do so.~
@37383 = ~Betrothed of Zaem Astyr

We met Jaebrilla, the betrothed of Zaem Astyr today.  She seems genuinely distraught over his death.~
@37384 = ~Creation of Zaem Astyr

We asked Jaebrilla about the creature mentioned in the diary that we found.  She said that she was not aware that Zaem kept a diary, nor did she know any of the details regarding his work.  It seems that Zaem considered his work confidential and refused to talk about it.  Would a man keep such secrets even from his betrothed?  In any case, we asked her who would know of Zaem's work.  In her opinion only Saablic Tan, his superior, and Kav Lathram, his apprentice, would know.~
@37385 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We believe that Cedrin murdered Zaem and read his notes.  We need to confront him with this.~
@37386 = ~Death of Zaem Astyr

We spoke with Jaebrilla again to let her know that the murderer of her betrothed is dead.  Justice has been served in this matter.~
@37459 = ~Xavier Torsend

We met Xavier Torsend, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  We asked him his opinion of the war between the Legion of the Chimera and the Ten-Towns.  He believes the war to be a senseless misunderstanding.~
@37460 = ~Cause of war

Xavier told us that the war was caused by Betran Weaver, the mayor of Bryn Shander, and his advisor Cardaf, a priest of Helm.  It seems that they sent Isair and Madae cakes made with holy water, knowing that the twins were cambions and would come to harm when they ate them.  An act of stupidity that has cost many their lives.~
@37461 = ~Cause of war

The envoy who delivered the cakes has been imprisoned in one of the towers of the Severed Hand.  Perhaps a rescue would be in order.~
@37462 = ~Cause of war

We asked Xavier if we could see the envoy imprisoned in the tower.  He was unable to help us, but says that we can speak to the captain of the guard about the matter.  He is in the Officer's Tower, off of the fourth floor of the fortress.~
@37463 = ~Severed Hand Delegate Pass

We have been given a delegate pass.  With it we can travel unmolested through most of the Severed Hand.~
@37464 = ~Slaves in Severed Hand

We asked Xavier about the slaves working at the Severed Hand.  Incredibly, he did not know they were slaves.  We pressed the matter and he decided to look into it for himself.  When he discovered the truth of the matter, he resigned his position and left.~
@37610 = ~Barrow Wight

A young woman named Pairi told us that some men had recently passed by the village, entering the woods to the east and never returning.  Pairi said that the angry ghost began to haunt the western hunting grounds shortly thereafter.~
@37697 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

The Iron Collar mercenaries would not come peacefully, so we were forced to deal with them.  I doubt Shawford will have any more problems with any other companies on the Palisade after they hear about what happened at the Salty Dog.~
@37771 = ~Lead Iron Collar to the Palisade

The Iron Collar mercenaries would not come peacefully, so we were forced to deal with them.  I doubt Shawford will have any more problems with any other companies on the Palisade after they hear about what happened at the Salty Dog.~
@37865 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

A dryad we met in the woods told us of a path through one portion of the forest.  She said that when we reach a pond to travel east, northeast, and then northwest.  This will take us to a creek from where we should go northwest, northeast, and then southeast.  The dryad said that this path leads into the heart of the forest.~
@37968 = ~Vunarg

We encountered this strange goblin chieftain, convinced him to take his clan, and leave without a fight.  At least that is one less battle we will have to contend with.~
@38062 = ~Wounded dwarf Gerbash

We found a wounded dwarf named Gerbash - he had been wounded with yuan-ti arrows and had slipped into one of the houses in Kuldahar to hide from them.~
@38063 = ~Wounded dwarf Gerbash

We were able to aid Gerbash with some healing magic.  It didn't do much for his grumpy disposition, however.~
@38160 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

A young woman named Pairi told us of a hidden path in the eastern woods.  When we reach a narrow clearing with a stump, we are to travel north, east, and east again.  It's supposed to lead somewhere otherwise inaccessible.~
@38361 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

Venla the Healer told us of a hidden trail in the woods east of the village.  In a large clearing split by a switch-back and three twisted, limbless trees, we're to go northeast, southeast, northwest, and then southeast again.  It should lead to some standing stones.~
@38410 = ~Barrow Wight

One of our number composed a heroic song for Sordirsin the barrow wight... the spirit was grateful and left for Warrior's Rest, claiming that we could take whatever we liked from his now-vacant tomb.~
@38572 = ~Elemental in Orrick's Tower

We encountered an... elemental within Orrick's tower.  It appears to be holding a number of items at Orrick's request, but considering that Orrick left many years ago, this elemental has been hanging around for some time.~
@38573 = ~Elemental in Orrick's Tower

We were able to set the elemental free by telling it the name of the first person to cross the tower threshold since Orrick left.  Now Orrick's store has been transferred to Sheemish.  We feel as we've learned some from the experience, but the matter is still rather confusing.~
@38814 = ~Band of Assassins

Viizra Arabani told us she'd heard word of a band of Lolthian assassins somewhere in the great cavern.  They've apparently come to kill Malavon.~
@38815 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

We spoke to a ranger named Jermsy, who was holed up with Nathaniel inside a watchtower in Kuldahar Pass.  He seemed none too happy to see us, despite Nathaniel's tales of our efforts in the Ice Temple.  Kuldahar seems plagued by that priest of Bane we met when we arrived.  Apparently, the priest is holed up in Hrothgar's Glen, and in addition to the undead he's raised within the Glen, he's sent bands of wights and undead archers into the Pass to terrorize the remaining people in Kuldahar.  Nathaniel said if we wished to confront him, he had altered the druidic seal on the gate to the Glen to the north so we could enter and deal with the Banite - it looks like we'll need to wipe them all out in order to clear Kuldahar Pass of the undead.~
@38816 = ~Tower Key

Jermsy mentioned someone named Gerbash who made a run to Kuldahar a few nights earlier, and Jermsy is concerned that he may have been captured or killed.  Apparently, Gerbash was also carrying a key to the watchtower, and Jermsy is worried that the key will fall into the hands of the enemy.  Jermsy asked us to return it to him if we find it - whether Gerbash lives or not.~
@38817 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

We returned and told Jermsy we had defeated the priest of Bane.  He seemed surprised - apparently, he didn't believe Nathaniel's tales about us.~
@38818 = ~Tower Key

We returned to the watchtower and gave Jermsy the watchtower key he had been looking for.~
@38952 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

After Nathaniel told us of her presence, we met a spirit floating within the shell of a burned out building in Kuldahar Pass.  She seemed to be searching for her two missing children, whoever they might be.~
@38953 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

The spirit appears to be the ghost of Mother Egenia, who apparently was the guardian of Isair and Madae - and loves them still.~
@38954 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

We asked for a vision of the future from the spirit, and she gave us one: She told us we would walk through the Dragon's Eye, to the Bloodied Fields, and our journey would end within a hand of chaos.  There she said we would face the greatest test of our lives - and confront Isair and Madae for the last time.  She seemed to accept their fate, and asked us to be merciful on them.~
@38955 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

Mother Egenia told us that Isair and Madae's lives were tied to a shimmering mirror that rippled at one's touch.  She said that we should attack them there, else they would destroy us.~
@38956 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

Before she walked back into death, Egenia asked a haunting question - why are we at war with the Legion - why are we doing all this?  Is it for duty?  Honor?  Greed?  Glory?  Because it's the right thing to do?  Or is this all just happening by chance?  No matter what answer we give, the question still lingers.~
@38957 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

We were able to lay Mother Egenia's spirit to rest - she will haunt her home in Kuldahar Pass no longer.~
@39071 = ~Nathaniel in Dragon's Eye

We asked Nathaniel what he was doing in Dragon's Eye, and he seemed confused and said he had never set foot there.~
@39075 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

We told Nathaniel that we did not know the missing pieces of her life that Mother Egenia wished to know, and he suggested we speak to Iselore about the matter.~
@39076 = ~Ghost of Mother Egenia

We told Nathaniel we had set Mother Egenia's spirit to rest, and he thanked us.  He looked as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders.  Perhaps her cries were plaguing him more than we thought.~
@39077 = ~Priest of Bane in the Pass

We told Nathaniel we had defeated the priest of Bane, and he thanked us.  He said we should tell Jermsy of our success.~
@39078 = ~Tower Key

We told Nathaniel we had found the watchtower key Gerbash had, and he said we should tell Jermsy at once.~
@39165 = ~Sheemish and Conlan

We encountered the Kuldahar blacksmith, Sheemish, inside a ruined mage tower.  He had found a cache of scrolls within the tower, and he was searching the rest of the place to see if he found anything interesting.~
@39166 = ~Sheemish and Conlan

Sheemish told us if we ran across his father, Conlan, in one of the houses to the south of the tower, to let him know that he was all right.~
@39167 = ~Tower Key

When we asked Sheemish about Gerbash, he mentioned he'd heard some fighting on the east side of town - perhaps Gerbash made his way there and ran afoul of the yuan-ti.~
@39283 = ~Tower Key

Gerbash gave us a key and told us to take it to Jermsy in the watchtower in Kuldahar Pass.~
@39488 = ~Making Driders

We found and destroyed some sort of drider-spawning monstrosity.  We should return to the drow encampment and inform Malavon.~
@39735 = ~Problems with Vylu Prehv

We spoke with Vylu Prehv.  She seems to be suffering from some sort of mental disorder.  She is incoherent to say the least.~
@39794 = ~Master of Locks

We met a man named the Master of Locks in one of the glacier's crevices.  He was escaping from a prison in the ice temple, and said someone named Nathaniel, who was being held there, knew us and was hoping we would rescue him.~
@40877 = ~Prism

Nickademus explained that the prism launches bolts of lightning that reflect off of any mirror they strike until spent.  It's driven by two control panels, one to rotate it in one of eight directions, and the other to fire at its current facing.  The second floor contains two traps and four doors that can only be disabled or opened by one of the prism's bolts.~
@40878 = ~Sacrificial dais

When asked about the dais in Lysara's sacrificial chamber on the first floor, Nickademus explained that it can be rotated left and right in one of eight directions, with its north position facing the center of the abishai lair behind the set of three doors in that room.  To unlock Oria's study, we should turn the dais left to the southwest then right to the northwest; to open the doors to the abishai den, it's left north then right north; to disable the prison's antimagic effects, it's right east then left west.~
@40879 = ~Game Room

Nickademus told us the workings of the Game Room on the southeast corner of this level.  He said it's controlled by thirteen switches: from its southwest corner, there's one that activates/deactivates the selected mode, the next two switches sets one of three modes (temple maintenance, the Inner Sanctum on the ethereal realm, and the Battle Square), and the next ten set the rank (difficulty of opponents you face in the Battle Square).  Nickademus stated that the temple maintenance mode is mostly used to repair the prism on the level, the ethereal realm is actually an Inner Sanctum on the ethereal plane where one of the priestesses, Oria, can go for solitude and meditation, and the third is the Battle Square, a small combat arena with prizes to be won for triumphing over one's foes.  To play Battle Square, we should set the desired rank, obtain three consecutive squares to win, possess three to seven squares when victorious to achieve rank levels one to five, achieve all levels of a rank to complete it, and complete all ranks for mastery.~
@40880 = ~Kuldahar painting

Nickademus informed us that the Kuldahar painting on the first floor, when hearing certain phrases it's been taught, will activate a teleporter embedded within the stairs below it that'll whisk us to a particular location.  For instance, if we tell it "Bedroom," then take the stairs, we'll end up in his bedroom.  Other phrases taught to it by the high priestesses, Sherincal, and others will lead to the Game Room, the altar cleansing room, a private treasure vault, the abishai den, and other places he was unfamiliar with.~
@40881 = ~Mirror of Life

According to Nickademus, the southwest room on the second floor has a Mirror of Life Trapping.  A group called Talisman was trapped inside while retrieving Nathaniel's equipment.  Nickademus couldn't safely extract them, but he said they would emerge from the mirror if we broke it, but their warped minds would mistakenly and violently blame us for their imprisonment.~
@40882 = ~Mirror of Life

According to Nickademus, the southwest room on the second floor had a Mirror of Life Trapping.  A group called Talisman was trapped inside while retrieving Nathaniel's equipment.  They were freed when we broke the mirror, but their warped minds mistakenly blamed us for their imprisonment.~
@40885 = ~Pass through the Fell Wood

Tahvo the Huntmaster suggested that, if we found ourselves lost and moving in circles in the woods east of the village, we try dropping stones or thrusting arrows into the earth to mark our progress.  He also mentioned making notes on our map.~
@41010 = ~Kuldahar painting

Nickademus told us that if we went up the eastern stairs of this level, we would come across a painting - he invited us to examine it and see if we could discover its abilities.  If it proved too difficult for us, he invited us to return, and he would explain how it worked.  ~
@41241 = ~Treasury riddle

One of the yuan-ti priests said the stones on the eastern side of the temple was some sort of combination lock for the temple treasury.  He said they often had to reset the lock by pressing the eleventh stone - usually after the temple's cook or one of the temple's assassins had paid it a visit during their wanderings. ~
@41332 = ~Ormis Dohor

We gave Ormis the antidote to his lemure condition.  In return, he vowed to aid us in our final confrontation with Isair and Madae.~
@41361 = ~Slaves in Severed Hand

We have destroyed the Globe of Essence and denied the demon's their immortality.  The slaves of the Hand can now be freed.~
@41362 = ~Histachii Transformation

We have replaced the modified root with the original one to maintain the deception.  Now we should bring the weaker brew to Nheero and inform him of our success.~
@41371 = ~The play of the flamewalkers

Before we said farewell to Lord Pyros, he told us to see one of the flamewalker plays in the amphitheater.  All we needed to do was speak to one of the flamewalkers, and they would perform for us. ~
@41383 = ~Assassination of Lord Piros

For reasons still unknown to us, Inquisitor Venomin murdered Lord Pyros with poison during their private meeting at the palace before fleeing to Ambassador Jasper's embassy.~
@41384 = ~Inquisitor Venomin

After seeking refuge at the embassy, Venomin confessed his crime to the diplomat, who instructed him to contact High Priest Thorasskus using a strange device.  An image of Thorasskus appeared atop the device, assuring the inquisitor that both he and the situation would be dealt with.  Moments later, King Lothar, apparently now in charge, proceeded to lay waste to the embassy.  It seems events are unfolding as Jasper described them to us when we arrived a day...ago?~
@41385 = ~Efreet Assassins

Once he destroyed the embassy, King Lothar sent summoned efreet assassins after Thorasskus.  They must have been the same ones we fought inside the high priest's chamber on the third level of Dragon's Eye, but how is that possible?  Are we dreaming?  Did we actually lose the battle against Thorasskus, and this is our penance in the Nine Hells?~
@41386 = ~The play of the flamewalkers

We agreed to see the flamewalkers' play... it must have been very long and or boring as we slept through most of it and into the night.  Though somewhat groggy, we saw King Lothar indiscreetly rip High Sorceress Izbelah from her cage and fatally toss her into the sea before returning to his abode.  Indeed, Jasper's suspicions of foul play were justified.  As we awoke, Venomin passed us in a hurry to get somewhere.~
@41387 = ~Lies of King Lothar

We overheard a conversation between Lothar and Venomin at the king's citadel.  Lothar lied convincingly, claiming Izbelah fell into the sea while trying to escape, that Pyros caused the eruption thirty years ago as well as the one about to occur, and that Pyros ordered Izbelah's execution.  As the meeting concluded, Venomin pondered having a private meeting with Pyros in the morning, but we think we know what transpired.  Needless to say, Lothar was less than pleased to find us eavesdropping.~
@41388 = ~Temporal Stasis spell

It all comes down to this:  from the ledge we can see High Sorceress Izbelah preparing to cast her Temporal Stasis spell that created this five-day time loop.  We must not let that happen - our lives - our futures - depend on it.~
@80050 = ~Icewind Dale

Orrick didn't come into Kuldahar much after the Legion had broken.  So much of his work had been lost that his life seemed wasted in his old age.

Once, I asked him what had happened when the Hand vanished on that fateful day. As he looked down from the safety of the mage's tower, he watched chunks of stone fall away and disappear. Eventually, trails of ethereal fire raced up the fingers, leaving lavender smoke and nothing more. When the haze cleared, his tower alone survived, hanging in the sky as a reminder of what once stood at the center of the valley.

Though I barely remember the adventurers now, we all remember how important they were to our lives. They stayed with us for a while longer, but moved with the changing of the seasons. Soon after the heroes had gone, Iselore planted a garden at the base of the great oak. For, he told us, the adventurers' memory should remain associated with the realm of the living. 

And, as I now realize, it is for the sake of the living that I now leave my home. Just as my mentor did when he came here, just as those adventurers did when they saved all of Icewind Dale. There are many roads left to travel, many deeds left to do, before the end of my days.~
@80084 = ~Ghost in the Inn

Through power of connection with the spirits alone, our shaman broke the will of the spirit from the Weeping Widow Inn and extracted a strange premonition from it.
The defeated spirit warned us of the "sign of the chimera," and said this sign threatened all of Targos.~
@80085 = ~Ghost in the Inn

Through power of connection with the spirits alone, our shaman broke the will of the spirit from the Weeping Widow Inn and extracted a strange premonition from it.
The innkeeper should be pleased to hear his inn is haunted no longer.~
